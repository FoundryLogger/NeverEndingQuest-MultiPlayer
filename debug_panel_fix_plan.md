# Debug Panel CSS Investigation Plan

## Goal
Fix the debug panel in the web interface to stay at the bottom of the screen without requiring scrolling, as it was previously working.

## Investigation Steps
1. Search for HTML template files (templates/game_interface.html)
2. Examine debug panel HTML structure
3. Search for CSS files that might contain debug panel styles
4. Look for JavaScript that might be dynamically styling the debug panel
5. Identify current styling issues with position, layout, and scroll behavior
6. Fix the debug panel positioning with proper CSS

## Files to Check
- templates/game_interface.html
- Any CSS files in the project
- JavaScript files that might modify debug panel styling
- Look for position: fixed, position: sticky, or bottom: 0 styling

## Expected Outcome
Debug panel should be always visible at the bottom of the screen without scrolling.
