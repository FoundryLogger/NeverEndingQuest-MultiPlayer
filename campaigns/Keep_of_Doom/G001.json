Scouring the trail, they noted weathered cairns marking the path and discerned faint bootprints in the soft earth—some fresh, some eroded—with a scrap of faded blue cloth caught on a thorn bush, linking to Elen’s uniform discovered earlier beneath the inn. Approaching a fork near the woods' edge, they observed two overgrown routes: one leading to the Abandoned Ranger Outpost, the other toward the Withered Shrine; subtle signs suggested recent passage along both. Exercising skill, Norn made a successful Survival check, revealing a trail of smaller, purposeful footprints heading north toward the Withered Shrine, accompanied by snapped twigs and disturbed moss signaling a brief pause. Nearby, a small silver coin lay beneath a cairn inscribed with the warning: \"Walk with light, for shadows hunger in the wood.\" This evidence solidified the trail toward the shrine as the party’s best lead on Elen’s fate and the unfolding mystery. With the forest’s silence pressing around them, they resolved to advance toward the Withered Shrine, marking a significant progression in their investigation before leaving the Witchlight Trailhead for new ground."
