While examining the central dais with its bowl-like depression, they were approached by what appeared to be a helpful wisp of light, but their keen insight revealed its malicious intent. Simultaneously, two specters rose from the ground, attacking as the party began inspecting the monoliths more closely. After defeating these spirits, they recovered several valuable items: a ward stone fragment, a scroll of protection, five ancient runestones, a silver ritual dagger, and most importantly, a tattered ritual book. The book contained instructions for renewing the wards, which they successfully performed after deciphering the arcane requirements. The ritual temporarily strengthened the circle's power, weakening the undead in the forest and revealing a clearer path forward. They also found evidence that Scout Elen had attempted the same ritual but fled when something went wrong. With the wards renewed, they could now proceed either back toward the Abandoned Ranger Outpost or onward to the mysterious Keeper's Cottage."
