Between battles, the player took brief respites, stepping away from the game before returning to the same mist-shrouded courtyard. Notably, the player's character, Norn, reached the experience threshold to level up to 5th level while in the courtyard, gaining the Extra Attack feature and increasing maximum hit points by 11 after rolling an 8 on a d10, accompanied by their Constitution modifier. Upon confirming understanding of hit point recovery mechanics, the player chose to restore those additional 11 hit points to their current health. After these developments, with all combat threats subdued and vital clues secured, the party stood poised to continue their investigation, deciding next to venture westward toward the unexplored Gatehouse Ruins in pursuit of Scout Elen's trail and the deeper secrets of Shadowfall Keep."

The heart amulet is crucial for later confronting Sir Garran, offering protection against his strongest powers. Giant rats may attack in groups and should be handled swiftly.

Norn then discovered a hidden compartment beneath the altar containing a small silver key, a chaplain's journal, blessed water, a silver holy symbol, and the Knight's heart amulet. The amulet provided magical resistance when worn. Shortly thereafter, giant rats attacked twice but were defeated, causing minor injuries.

The environment was quiet but tense, as the presence of one to three Giant Rats posed an immediate threat to the adventurers. The party proceeded cautiously, tracking the elusive trail left by Elen, their companion, weaving through the crumbling pews and collapsed altar. No traps were triggered during their movement, and the adventurers remained alert for any signs of spectral guardians or magical defenses associated with the Keep of Doom. The party's progress was methodical, with characters relying on skill checks to navigate hazards and gather information, though no new discoveries were made beyond confirming the presence of the vermin threat. The atmosphere was thick with anticipation, as the adventurers understood this location was a crucial threshold leading to the Outer Courtyard, the next area to be explored in their quest to breach the Keep. Throughout their exploration, the party's stats and conditions were closely monitored, including Norn's status as a level 4 character who had recently surpassed the threshold to level up. The encounter in The Ruined Chapel concluded without direct combat, as the party focused on following their trail and preparing for the challenges ahead, ultimately deciding to transition to the adjacent Outer Courtyard to continue their mission.\n\nCurrent Game Time: 1492 Ches 2, 02:10:00",

Rainwater has pooled on the stone floors, reflecting the open sky above like dark mirrors. The higher one climbs, the more unstable the structure becomes, with walls cracked and floors tilting at dangerous angles. At the very top, a small observatory platform somehow remains, offering a panoramic view marred only by the unnatural shadows that seem to cling to the keep regardless of the sun's position.",
