The general store lay a short walk behind them, while the open gate invited the adventurers eastward onto the Witchlight Trailhead, a path leading deeper into the forest and toward the haunted Keep of Doom. With no traps detected in the area and the recent lifting of a curse garnering them acclaim and rewards from Elder Mirna and the villagers, the party stood celebrated as heroes within the village. After considering their options, the party chose to leave the village behind and proceeded through the gate to embark on the Witchlight Trailhead, venturing into the unknown territories of Gloamwood to continue their adventure.
