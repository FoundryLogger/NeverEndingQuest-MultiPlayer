Active side quests hinted at spectral encounters and poltergeist disturbances, promising clues to the mystery. After some exploration and interaction, the player character decided to return to a spot on the Witchlight Trailhead where footprints had been previously discovered, indicating a strategic move to follow leads outside the gate area. Throughout their time at the East Gate and Guardhouse, the party carefully updated their knowledge, plot progression, and maintained readiness for the challenges ahead, with no combat or traps triggered within this zone before their transition to the adjacent Witchlight Trailhead area.
