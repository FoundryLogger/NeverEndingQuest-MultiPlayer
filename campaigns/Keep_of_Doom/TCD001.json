Several cots remain in various states of decay along the back wall, and a small shrine to forgotten gods of order and justice stands here, now cleansed and restored, its holy presence dispelling lingering shadows. The ceiling is lower here than in other chambers, creating a sense of claustrophobia, and supporting pillars cast distinctive cross-shaped shadows regardless of light source position. A barred gate designed to control access stands partially open, its mechanism long since failed. The chamber bears signs of recent combat, but the threat has been eliminated.",

Seven pillars arranged in a circle support the domed ceiling, each carved with scenes depicting the relic's history and power. The air here feels thick and resistant, as if reality itself struggles against dissolution, and shadows cast by any light source move independently and reach toward living creatures. Whispers constantly emanate from the relic, speaking in multiple overlapping voices promising power, revenge, or salvation depending on who listens. At the chamber's far side, a throne-like chair holds the fully manifested form of Sir Garran Vael, now more shadow than man, his armor fused with his corrupted flesh and his eyes burning with conflicted purpose.",

Sir Garran attacks when players approach the relic, commanding shadow manifestations to aid him. The Knight's Heart Amulet is crucial--when presented and accompanied by words calling to his humanity (referencing his love, duty, or original purpose), it forces a DC 15 Wisdom save from Sir Garran. Success means he briefly regains control, allowing negotiation or providing advantage against him for 1d4 rounds. The shadow relic attempts to influence party members with whispered offers (DC 14 Wisdom saves to resist). Players can choose to destroy the relic (requiring specific light-based attacks discovered earlier), contain it using the ritual markings (requiring Arcana DC 16), or attempt to cleanse it of corruption (requiring the Knight's Heart and a major sacrifice). Each choice has different consequences for Sir Garran, Scout Elen, and the keep's future. Scout Elen can be freed by destroying her shadow cage (AC 15, 20 HP, vulnerable to radiant damage).",
