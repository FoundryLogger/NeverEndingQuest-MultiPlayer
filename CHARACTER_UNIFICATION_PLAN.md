# Character System Unification Plan

## Overview
Merge NPC and Player Character systems into a single unified character schema and management system. This will eliminate code duplication and provide consistent functionality for all characters.

## Current State Analysis

### Files Currently Using Separate Systems:
- `char_schema.json` - Player character schema
- `npc_schema.json` - NPC schema  
- `update_player_info.py` - Player character updates
- `update_npc_info.py` - NPC character updates

### Key Differences to Resolve:
1. **Schema Fields**: NPCs missing ammunition, personality traits, class features
2. **Update Logic**: Different validation and processing approaches
3. **File Paths**: Separate directory structures
4. **Prompts**: Different system prompts and examples

## Unification Strategy

### Phase 1: Schema Unification ✅ PLANNING
**Goal**: Create single unified character schema

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `unified_character_schema.json` combining both schemas
- [ ] Add discriminator field `character_role` (player/npc/monster/ally)
- [ ] Make PC-specific fields optional for NPCs
- [ ] Keep NPC-specific fields (size, actions) optional for PCs
- [ ] Update schema validation logic

#### Schema Design:
```json
{
  "character_role": "enum[player, npc, monster, ally, companion]",
  "character_type": "string (legacy support)",
  "type": "string (legacy support)", 
  
  // Core fields (required for all)
  "name": "required",
  "level": "required",
  "race": "required",
  "class": "required",
  
  // PC-focused fields (optional for NPCs)
  "ammunition": "optional array",
  "personality_traits": "optional",
  "ideals": "optional", 
  "bonds": "optional",
  "flaws": "optional",
  "experience_points": "optional",
  "exp_required_for_next_level": "optional",
  
  // NPC-focused fields (optional for PCs)
  "size": "optional enum",
  "actions": "optional array",
  "personality": "optional string (fallback)",
  
  // Universal fields
  "classFeatures": "required array",
  "racialTraits": "required array", 
  "backgroundFeature": "required object",
  "temporaryEffects": "required array",
  "feats": "required array"
}
```

### Phase 2: Update System Unification ✅ PLANNING  
**Goal**: Single update function for all characters

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `update_character_info.py` (unified system)
- [ ] Implement character role-based logic branching
- [ ] Migrate validation rules from both systems
- [ ] Handle ammunition tracking for all characters
- [ ] Preserve specialized NPC combat action handling
- [ ] Update path management for unified access

#### Update Logic Design:
```python
def update_character_info(character_name, changes, character_role="auto-detect"):
    # Auto-detect role from existing data if not specified
    if character_role == "auto-detect":
        character_role = detect_character_role(character_name)
    
    # Load appropriate schema validation
    schema = load_unified_schema()
    
    # Role-specific processing
    if character_role == "player":
        # Enhanced validation, experience tracking
        pass
    elif character_role in ["npc", "monster", "ally"]:
        # Combat action protection, simplified validation
        pass
        
    # Universal processing
    # - Ammunition tracking
    # - Equipment management
    # - Ability/feature updates
    # - Status conditions
```

### Phase 3: File System Unification ✅ PLANNING
**Goal**: Single directory structure for all characters

#### Current Structure:
```
campaigns/Keep_of_Doom/
├── norn.json (player)
└── npcs/
    └── test_guard.json (npc)
```

#### Proposed Structure:
```
campaigns/Keep_of_Doom/
└── characters/
    ├── norn.json (role: player)
    ├── test_guard.json (role: npc)
    └── captain_arannis.json (role: ally)
```

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create migration script for file reorganization
- [ ] Update `CampaignPathManager` for unified paths
- [ ] Create `get_character_path(name)` method
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- [ ] Update all references to old path structure

### Phase 4: Prompt System Unification ✅ PLANNING
**Goal**: Single set of prompts with role-aware content

#### Files to Update:
- [ ] `system_prompt.txt` - Main game system prompt
- [ ] Create `character_update_prompt.txt` - Unified update guidance
- [ ] `validation_prompt.txt` - Universal validation rules
- [ ] `npc_builder_prompt.txt` - Update to use unified schema

#### Prompt Strategy:
- Single comprehensive character schema documentation
- Role-specific examples and guidance
- Universal validation rules
- Clear ammunition and resource tracking instructions

### Phase 5: Code Migration ✅ PLANNING
**Goal**: Update all systems to use unified approach

#### Files Requiring Updates:
- [ ] `main.py` - Character loading and display
- [ ] `combat_manager.py` - Character data access
- [ ] `level_up.py` - Character progression
- [ ] `npc_builder.py` - Character creation
- [ ] `templates/game_interface.html` - Display logic
- [ ] `campaign_path_manager.py` - Path management
- [ ] All validation and utility scripts

#### Migration Strategy:
- Create wrapper functions for backward compatibility
- Gradual migration with feature flags
- Comprehensive testing at each step
- Rollback capability for each phase

### Phase 6: Data Migration ✅ PLANNING
**Goal**: Convert existing characters to unified format

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `migrate_to_unified_schema.py`
- [ ] Convert existing players and NPCs
- [ ] Add missing fields with appropriate defaults
- [ ] Validate all migrated data
- [ ] Create rollback capability

#### Migration Logic:
```python
def migrate_character(char_data):
    # Detect current type
    if char_data.get("character_type") == "player":
        char_data["character_role"] = "player"
        # Add any missing NPC fields as optional
    else:
        char_data["character_role"] = "npc" 
        # Add missing PC fields with defaults
        
    # Ensure all required unified fields exist
    # Validate against unified schema
    return char_data
```

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation ✅ PLANNING
**Goal**: Ensure system stability and functionality

#### Test Cases:
- [ ] Create new characters (all roles)
- [ ] Update existing characters (all roles) 
- [ ] Combat system with unified characters
- [ ] Level up progression for all roles
- [ ] UI display for all character types
- [ ] Ammunition tracking for ranged characters
- [ ] Validation and error handling

## Rollback Strategy

### Backup Plan:
1. **Schema Backups**: Keep original schema files as `.backup`
2. **Code Backups**: Git branches for each phase
3. **Data Backups**: Character file backups before migration
4. **Validation**: Each phase must pass all existing tests

### Rollback Triggers:
- Data corruption or loss
- Performance degradation
- Critical functionality failures
- Test suite failures

## Success Metrics

### Functionality:
- [ ] All existing features work with unified system
- [ ] New characters can be created in any role
- [ ] Updates work consistently across all character types
- [ ] Combat system functions with unified characters

### Performance:
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable
- [ ] Response times maintain current levels

### Data Integrity:
- [ ] No data loss during migration
- [ ] All validation rules maintained
- [ ] Character relationships preserved

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
- **Data Loss**: Character data corruption during migration
- **System Instability**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Performance Impact**: Slower operations due to unified complexity

### Mitigation:
- Comprehensive backups before each phase
- Incremental implementation with rollback points
- Extensive testing at each step
- Parallel system operation during transition
