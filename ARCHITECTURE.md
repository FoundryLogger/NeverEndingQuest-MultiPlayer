## Design Philosophy

NeverEndingQuest is built on several core principles that differentiate it from traditional tabletop RPG systems:

### 1. **Continuous Adventure Generation**
Unlike episodic adventures with defined endings, NeverEndingQuest creates an infinite, evolving narrative. Each module seamlessly flows into the next, creating a living world that grows with your adventures.

### 2. **Geographic Boundaries, Not Chapters**
Adventures are organized by physical locations (modules) rather than story chapters. When you leave one area and enter another, the game naturally transitions between modules while maintaining complete story continuity.

### 3. **Perfect Memory Through Compression**
The system remembers everything - every NPC interaction, every battle, every decision - through an innovative multi-tier compression system that manages AI context limitations while preserving narrative richness.

### 4. **Schema-Driven Flexibility**
All game content uses JSON schemas, allowing modifications without touching code. Add new locations, NPCs, items, or mechanics by simply following the established patterns.

### Key Components:

- **DungeonMasterAI**: The primary AI that narrates adventures and responds to player actions
- **Action Handler**: Processes player commands and updates game state
- **Module System**: Self-contained adventure areas with locations, NPCs, and plotlines
- **Compression Engine**: Multi-tier system that compresses conversations while preserving story elements
- **State Manager**: Maintains consistent game state across sessions

## Conversation & Context Management

The system maintains a primary conversation history that serves as the AI's memory:

### Primary Context Window
```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "Game rules and current location details"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Module summary from previous adventures"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Location transition: Area A to Area B"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "=== LOCATION SUMMARY ===\n[Compressed journey narrative]"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Recent player action"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recent game response"}
]
```

### Context Injection Strategy

1. **Base Context**: Core game rules and character sheets (always present)
2. **Module Context**: Current module's plot state and active quests
3. **Location Context**: Detailed description of current location, NPCs, and available actions
4. **Historical Context**: Compressed summaries of relevant past events
5. **Recent Context**: Last 10-20 conversation turns in full detail

### Location-Specific Details

When a character enters a location, the system:
1. Loads the complete location file (areas/XXX.json)
2. Injects full location details into context
3. Retrieves any location-specific history from the journal
4. Updates NPCs based on past interactions

## The Compression Pipeline

The revolutionary compression system maintains infinite adventure history through progressive summarization:

### Tier 1: Individual Conversations
Raw player-AI exchanges during exploration and combat.

### Tier 2: Location Summaries
When leaving a location, conversations are compressed into a narrative summary:
```
=== LOCATION SUMMARY ===

The party's time at the Riverside Outpost proved eventful. Upon arriving at the 
fog-shrouded settlement, they discovered the ranger station under siege...
[Continues with key events, combat outcomes, NPC interactions, and discoveries]
```

### Tier 3: Journey Chronicles (8-Location Chunks)
When 15+ location summaries accumulate, the oldest 8 are compressed into a chronicle:
```
=== AI-GENERATED CHRONICLE ===

From the Riverside Outpost through the Thornwood paths to Shadowfell Keep, the 
party's journey grew ever more perilous. The corrupted bell towers they discovered 
at the outpost were but the first sign of Malarok's growing influence...
[Rich narrative covering 8 locations' worth of adventure]
```

### Tier 4: Module Summaries
When completing a module, all chronicles combine into a complete adventure summary stored in the campaign archive.

### Compression Example Flow:
```
300 conversation turns (exploration, combat, dialogue)
    ↓ Compress when leaving location
1 Location Summary (2-3 paragraphs preserving key events)
    ↓ Accumulate 15 summaries
Chronicle Generation (8 summaries → 1 chronicle)
    ↓ Complete module
Module Summary (all chronicles → complete adventure record)
```

## Modular Architecture

### Self-Contained Modules
Each module is a complete, playable adventure:
```
modules/[module_name]/
├── areas/              # All locations in this module
├── characters/         # NPCs and pre-generated characters
├── monsters/           # Unique creatures for this module
├── encounters/         # Pre-designed combat scenarios
├── module_plot.json    # Plot progression and quests
└── [module_name]_module.json  # Module metadata
```

### Seamless Module Transitions

1. **Automatic Detection**: When a player moves to a location in a different module
2. **Context Preservation**: Current module's state is saved
3. **Summary Generation**: Adventure summary created for completed areas
4. **New Module Loading**: Next module loads with full context of past adventures
5. **Narrative Bridge**: AI creates seamless transition narrative

### Drop-In Module Support

To add a new adventure:
1. Create module folder following the structure above
2. Define locations with connections to existing areas
3. Drop into modules/ directory
4. System automatically integrates it into the world

No configuration needed - the module becomes part of the living world!

## Technical Implementation

### Schema-Based Design
Every game element follows strict JSON schemas:
- **Character Schema**: Defines all possible character attributes
- **Location Schema**: Structure for areas, NPCs, items, and encounters  
- **Action Schema**: Valid player actions and their effects
- **Combat Schema**: Turn-based combat rules and validation

This allows adding new content without coding - just follow the schema!

### Verbose Prompting Strategy
Current prompts are intentionally detailed for reliability:
```python
# Example prompt structure
"You are a DM for a 5th edition campaign. The party is currently at {location}.
Available exits are {exits}. NPCs present are {npcs}. The player has said {action}.
Respond as a DM would, describing what happens..."
```

While verbose, this ensures consistent AI behavior across different scenarios.

### State Management
- **Atomic Operations**: All state changes use backup-modify-verify patterns
- **Session State**: Maintained in party_tracker.json
- **Location State**: Stored in individual area files
- **Character State**: Personal character files with backup versioning

### AI Model Specialization
Different models for different tasks:
- **Main DM**: GPT-4 for rich narrative generation
- **Combat Validator**: Ensures rule compliance
- **Summarizer**: Compressed narrative generation
- **Content Generator**: Creating new NPCs, locations, items

## Data Flow Philosophy

### **Primary Data Flow**
The main game loop follows a standard unidirectional flow for most interactions:

```
User Input → Action Parsing → AI Processing → Validation → State Update → Persistence
```

### **Sub-System Data Flow (e.g., Combat)**
For complex, multi-turn sub-systems like combat, the architecture uses a recursive, signal-based flow to maintain control and ensure chronological history.

1. **Initiation:** `main.py` receives an action (e.g., `createEncounter`).
2. **Delegation:** `main.py` passes control to the `action_handler.py`.
3. **Blocking Execution:** The `action_handler` calls the sub-system (e.g., `combat_manager.py`), which takes over the game loop completely. The main loop is paused.
4. **Self-Contained History:** The sub-system runs its course and generates its own historical record (e.g., a combat summary).
5. **Signal Return:** The `action_handler` injects the historical record into the main conversation history and returns a special signal (e.g., `needs_post_combat_narration`) to `main.py`.
6. **Recursive Narration:** `main.py` sees the signal, reloads the updated history, and makes a new call to the AI to get a seamless, in-character transition back to the main game.
7. **Loop Continues:** The turn concludes, and the main loop awaits the next player input.

This pattern ensures that complex sub-systems are self-contained, manage their own history correctly, and provide a seamless narrative experience for the player.

### **Signal-Based Sub-System Control**
The main loop uses signals returned from the action handler to manage the flow between standard gameplay and special sub-systems:
- `needs_post_combat_narration`: Combat has concluded, request follow-up narration
- `enter_levelup_mode`: Start interactive level-up session
- `exit`: Clean game shutdown
- `restart`: Reload from save

This signal-based architecture keeps the main loop simple while allowing arbitrarily complex sub-systems to operate independently.
