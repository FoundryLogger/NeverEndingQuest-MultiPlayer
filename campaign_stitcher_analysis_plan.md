# Campaign Stitcher Analysis Plan

## Objective
Analyze the existing campaign stitcher system to understand:
- Module availability logic
- Module transition mechanisms  
- Plot completion requirements
- Integration with main game systems

## Investigation Steps
1. Search for stitcher-related files
2. Analyze module transition logic
3. Examine plot completion tracking
4. Review module availability mechanics
5. Document integration points
6. Assess compatibility requirements

## Key Questions
- How does the system determine when modules become available?
- What triggers module unlocking after plot completion?
- How are module sequences managed?
- What metadata is required for proper functioning?
- How does it integrate with the main game loop?

## Output
Comprehensive analysis document detailing campaign stitcher functionality and requirements for automatic module sequencing compatibility.
