  "description": "A sturdy timber-and-stone building at the town's heart, the general store is the main source of goods for Harrow's Hollow, catering to both locals and frontiersfolk. Shelves brim with tools, dried provisions, lanterns, and the occasional oddity from distant lands. The air smells of wax, old paper, and leather, and handwritten notices clutter a bulletin board near the counter. Elder Mirna Harrow stands behind the wooden counter with a concerned yet respectful gaze, reflecting the unease hanging over the village due to recent disappearances and the dark influence of the ancient keep.",
