Respond with a JSON object:
{
  "valid": true/false,
  "errors": ["List of specific rule violations"],
  "warnings": ["Minor issues or clarifications needed"],
  "recommendation": "If invalid, explain exactly what needs to be corrected"
}

Focus on rule accuracy. The assistant should be guiding the player through valid 5E leveling choices, not making up rules or offering impossible options.
