  "description": "This massive, hunched creature has mottled gray-green skin, yellow tusks protruding from its lower jaw, and small, beady eyes that gleam with malice. Its massive arms nearly drag on the ground, ending in wicked claws. The cave troll's thick hide is covered in rocky growths that blend with its surroundings, making it surprisingly difficult to spot when motionless. A powerful stench of rot and earth emanates from the beast.",
  "behavior": "Cave trolls are territorial and aggressive, attacking intruders on sight. They are surprisingly cunning hunters, often waiting motionless to ambush prey. They prefer to begin combat by throwing rocks from hiding, then closing to melee range to use their devastating bite and claw attacks. Their regenerative abilities make them exceptionally difficult to kill unless fire or acid is used.",
  "habitat": "Deep caves, rocky highlands, and underground caverns. They favor areas near water sources where they can retreat if severely injured."
