  "description": "A foreboding cave mouth yawns from the base of a craggy cliff face. Ancient tree roots twist around the entrance like grasping fingers, and the air coming from within feels unnaturally cold. Water trickles down the stone walls, forming small, stagnant pools near the entrance. Moss and pale fungi grow in patches, giving off a faint, eerie luminescence that barely illuminates the immediate area. The distant sound of dripping water echoes from deep within, occasionally punctuated by strange rumbling noises that might be shifting stones... or something else entirely.",

  "ambience": "The air is thick with the smell of earth and decay. Occasional drafts from deeper in the cave bring an unpleasant, musky odor. The temperature drops noticeably as you step inside, and sound behaves strangely, sometimes muffled and sometimes amplified by the cave's acoustics."
