    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The AI generally used the correct JSON format, with 'narration' and 'actions' fields present. However, the 'actions' array sometimes lacked specificity (e.g., 'changes' was a string rather than a structured object with HP values), and there was inconsistent use of required parameters like explicit HP changes or unique identifiers for combatants."
  },
  "combatRules": {
    "score": 5,
    "comments": "The AI handled initiative, attack rolls, and damage calculation for NPCs correctly, but failed to follow the system prompt's requirement that the AI itself rolls dice for all NPCs and monsters. Critically, it also asked the player to roll for their own attacks, which is not in line with the prompt's instructions."
  },
  "narrationQuality": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The narration was vivid and engaging, with strong sensory details (e.g., 'snarling goblins leap from behind jagged rocks', 'arrow flies true'), and clear combat descriptions. The setting and action were well described, enhancing immersion."
  },
  "tacticalIntelligence": {
    "score": 6,
    "comments": "The goblins targeted both the player and an ally, showing some tactical spread. However, there was no evidence of advanced tactics (such as focus fire, use of cover, or disengagement), and the monster/NPC actions were fairly basic."
  },
  "playerInteraction": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The AI provided clear prompts for the player's turn and described the consequences of NPC actions. However, it failed to handle the player's attack roll and damage itself, instead asking the player to roll, which is against the system's requirements."
  },
  "tracking": {
    "score": 6,
    "comments": "The AI tracked HP changes and referenced AC correctly, but did not provide explicit HP totals after damage, nor did it update or display ongoing conditions or positions. The 'changes' field in actions was vague and not machine-readable."
  },
  "turnManagement": {
    "score": 9,
    "comments": "The AI only prompted the player for input on their turn, correctly sequencing initiative and not interrupting with out-of-turn requests."
  },
  "inventoryStateUpdates": {
    "score": 5,
    "comments": "There was no evidence of inventory tracking or updates (e.g., arrows used, weapons dropped), nor did the AI prompt for or handle any state changes beyond HP loss."
  },
  "diceRollHandling": {
    "score": 3,
    "comments": "The AI rolled dice for NPCs and monsters but incorrectly asked the player to roll for their own attack, which violates the system prompt's requirement that the AI handle all dice rolls for all combatants."
  },
  "actionImplementation": {
    "score": 6,
    "comments": "The AI used 'updatePlayerInfo' and 'updateNPCInfo' actions, but the 'parameters' were not structured for programmatic parsing (e.g., 'changes' as a freeform string). There was no use of more granular or explicit state update commands."
  },
  "immersion": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The AI maintained a strong fantasy atmosphere, with evocative setting and combat descriptions. The world felt alive and dangerous, though the lack of environmental interaction limited full immersion."
  },
  "overallScore": 6,
  "strengths": [
    "Vivid and immersive narration",
    "Correct initiative and turn management",
    "Clear communication of combat events"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Did not follow dice roll handling requirements (asked player to roll)",
    "Action commands and state updates were not machine-readable or explicit",
    "Limited tactical depth and inventory/state tracking"
  ],
  "recommendedPromptImprovements": [
    "Explicitly instruct the AI to always roll all dice for all combatants, including the player character, and never ask the player to roll.",
    "Require structured, machine-readable state updates (e.g., explicit HP before/after, condition flags, inventory changes).",
    "Encourage more advanced monster tactics and environmental interaction.",
    "Remind the AI to display updated HP and conditions after each action."
  ],
  "summary": "The combat AI provided immersive narration and managed initiative and turn order well, but failed to adhere to critical system requirements regarding dice rolling and explicit, structured state updates. Improvements in dice handling, action command structure, and tactical depth are needed for full compliance and a more robust simulation."
