    "comments": "The AI's responses were wrapped in a JSON object with 'narration' and 'actions' fields, but the 'actions' array was always empty, even when state changes (such as initiative order, monster appearance, or prompting for rolls) occurred. The schema expects explicit use of action commands like 'updateNPCInfo', 'updatePlayerInfo', or 'requestPlayerRoll', which were missing."

  "combatRules": {
    "score": 5,
    "comments": "The AI handled initiative and attack rolls in a D&D-like manner, but did not actually roll initiative or display initiative values. It asked the player to roll for attack and damage, which is against the system prompt (the AI should handle all dice rolls except for player attacks/saves). There was no evidence of AC, HP, or other combat stats being tracked or updated."
  },
  "narrationQuality": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The narration was vivid and immersive, effectively setting the scene and describing the goblins' behavior and the environment. The combat description was energetic and clear, helping the player visualize the action."
  },
  "tacticalIntelligence": {
    "score": 5,
    "comments": "The AI described goblins using cover and attempting to flank, which is appropriate, but did not actually resolve any NPC or monster actions, so tactical depth was not demonstrated beyond initial setup."
  },
  "playerInteraction": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The AI gave the player clear options and responded to their declared actions. However, it incorrectly asked the player to roll for damage (should be handled by the AI), and did not use explicit schema commands for requesting player input."
  },
  "tracking": {
    "score": 4,
    "comments": "There was no explicit tracking or updating of HP, initiative order, or combatant states in the 'actions' array. The AI narrated the situation but did not use the schema to update or display game state."
  },
  "turnManagement": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The AI only prompted the player for input on their turn, correctly managing the flow of turns. However, it did not handle the NPC turns at all within these two rounds."
  },
  "inventoryStateUpdates": {
    "score": 3,
    "comments": "No inventory or state updates were tracked or communicated via the schema. The AI did not use any action commands to reflect changes in character or monster state."
  },
  "diceRollHandling": {
    "score": 4,
    "comments": "The AI asked the player to roll for both attack and damage, but per prompt, the AI should handle all dice rolls except for player attacks and saving throws. It should have rolled for damage itself and used action commands to update HP."
  },
  "actionImplementation": {
    "score": 2,
    "comments": "No action commands (such as 'updatePlayerInfo', 'updateNPCInfo', or 'requestPlayerRoll') were used, despite multiple opportunities. The 'actions' array was always empty."

  "immersion": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The AI maintained a strong sense of atmosphere, using evocative language to describe the cavern and the tension of the encounter."

  "strengths": [
    "Vivid and immersive narration",
    "Clear turn management and player prompting",

  "weaknesses": [
    "Did not use required action commands or update game state in the schema",

  "recommendedPromptImprovements": [
    "Emphasize that all state changes (HP, initiative, inventory) must be reflected using explicit action commands in the 'actions' array.",
    "Clarify that the AI must handle all dice rolls except for player attack rolls and saving throws, and must use action commands to communicate results.",
    "Require that the AI always update and display initiative order, HP, and other relevant combat stats after each action.",
    "Provide examples of correct 'actions' array usage for common combat events."
  ],
  "summary": "The AI provided immersive and engaging narration with clear player interaction and turn management, but failed to adhere to the required JSON schema for state updates and action commands. Combat rules were loosely followed, but critical aspects like dice roll handling and game state tracking were not implemented as specified. Improvements to prompt clarity and schema enforcement are needed for better performance."
