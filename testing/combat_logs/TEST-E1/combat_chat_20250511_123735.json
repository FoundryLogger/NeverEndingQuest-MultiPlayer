Suddenly, three menacing goblins leap from behind loose rocks, snarling and raising their crude scimitars. The air thickens with tension as battle begins. Initiative order is: The first goblin, your ally Aric (the rogue), the second goblin, then you, followed by the third goblin and the party's wizard, Mira. The first goblin lunges forward quickly. It swings its scimitar at Aric. Rolling the d20 for the goblin's attack... a 14 before modifiers, plus 4 for attack, totals 18. This hits Aric's AC of 15. Damage roll is 1d6 + 2 slashing damage... rolling 1d6... it's a 3, plus 2 equals 5 damage. Aric winces but remains ready. Aric grins, blood splattered across his face, and says, \\\"Let's show these pests what stealth and precision can do.\\\" He draws his shortsword and prepares to strike the first goblin. Now it's the second goblin's turn. It targets the wizard Mira, attempting a Scimitar attack. Rolling for attack: d20 comes up 9 plus 4 equals 13, not enough to breach Mira's AC of 14. The scimitar swings wide, missing its mark. Your turn, brave adventurer. The goblins are circling, and Aric is poised for another attack. What do you want to do? Please roll a d20 for your attack and add your attack modifier of +6.\",\n  \"actions\": []\n}"
