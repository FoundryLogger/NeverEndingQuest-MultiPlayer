The wolves, driven by hunger and familiarity with their lair, move quickly. You ready your blade, tense for the battle to unfold.\\n\\nThe first wolf lunges at you, jaws snapping for your arm. Rolling its attack... the wolf gets an 8 on the d20, adding its +4 attack bonus for a total of 12. If your armor class is higher, you deftly raise your shield and deflect the bite; the wolf misses!\\n\\nThe second wolf, circling wide, tries to flank and snap at your other side. It rolls a 15, plus 4 for a total of 19. Please let me know if this meets or beats your armor class, and if so, I will roll for damage.\\n\\nYou're up next. What would you like to do?
