You tighten your hold on the leather-wrapped hilt of your longsword and focus, heart pounding in anticipation. The musty air drifting from the entrance is laced with an animalistic musk and, beneath it, the faintest stench of rot. Suddenly, from the gloom just beyond the cavern\u2019s threshold, a snarling figure lurches forward\u2014a squat, pink-skinned goblin with beady yellow eyes and a jagged shortsword raised high. A guttural yelp escapes its lips as it charges you with surprising speed. Behind it, you catch glimpses of two more goblins, each poised in the penumbra of the passage, eager for blood\u2014your blood.\\n\\nCombat begins! The turn order is: the first goblin, then you, next the second goblin, and finally the third goblin. Your NPC companion Tharn, a grizzled dwarven cleric, brings up the rear, his warhammer and shield ready. Tharn grunts, \\\"Stay close and don't let these pests swarm you! I'll watch your back.\\\"\\n\\nThe first goblin, emboldened by its wild cry, lunges at you from the right. It swings its shortsword with a hacking motion, aiming for your hip. Rolling a d20 for its attack\u2026 That\u2019s a 16, plus its attack bonus of +4, totaling 20. If your armor class is less than 20, the attack hits. Rolling 1d6+2 for damage\u2026 The goblin deals 5 points of slashing damage as its blade carves a shallow line across your thigh.\\n\\nYour pulse quickens as the next goblin raises its rusted blade, but for now, it\u2019s your turn! What do you do? Roll a d20 for your attack and add your longsword attack modifier. If you attack, let me know your roll and we\u2019ll resolve the hit.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updatePlayerInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"changes\": \"You lose 5 hit points from the goblin's attack.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
