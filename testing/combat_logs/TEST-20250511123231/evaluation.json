    "score": 6,
    "comments": "The AI mostly used JSON formatting, but there are notable issues: the first message lacks required fields like 'options' for the player, and the second message presents options for Elara (an NPC), not the player, which is a schema violation. The third message includes both 'narration' and 'narration_additional', which is inconsistent, and does not use required action commands (e.g., updateNPCInfo, updatePlayerInfo) for state changes."

  "combatRules": {
    "score": 6,
    "comments": "Initiative is rolled and displayed correctly, and attack rolls are made with plausible modifiers. However, the AI allows the player to act during Elara's turn and processes both Elara's and Aric's attacks in the same turn, violating turn order. No damage rolls or HP tracking are shown, and no action resolution (damage application, conditions, or state updates) is performed."
  },
  "narrationQuality": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "Descriptions are vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail: 'shadows shifting unnervingly', 'mossy stone for partial cover', 'sound of metal biting into flesh'. The narration effectively evokes the cavern's eerie setting and the tension of combat."
  },
  "tacticalIntelligence": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "Elara uses cover and a ranged attack, which is logical. However, the AI does not show any monster tactics or responses (the troll does not act), and it allows both PCs to act simultaneously, which is not tactically sound."
  },
  "playerInteraction": {
    "score": 5,
    "comments": "The AI does not clearly distinguish between player and NPC turns. It presents options for Elara (an NPC), not Aric (the player), and processes the player's action during Elara's turn, which is confusing and not in line with expectations."
  },
  "tracking": {
    "score": 4,
    "comments": "Initiative order is tracked, but there is no evidence of HP, conditions, or inventory tracking. No 'update' actions are issued, and the effects of attacks are not mechanically resolved (no HP loss, no slowed condition applied, etc.)."
  },
  "turnManagement": {
    "score": 3,
    "comments": "The AI asks for input and processes actions out of turn order, allowing Aric to act during Elara's turn and presenting options for Elara instead of the player. This is a significant deviation from required turn management."
  },
  "inventoryStateUpdates": {
    "score": 3,
    "comments": "There is no tracking or mention of inventory or state changes (e.g., ammunition, HP, conditions). No action commands are issued to update character or NPC states."
  },
  "diceRollHandling": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The AI rolls for attacks and presents plausible results, but does not roll for damage or handle critical hits/fails. Dice rolls are handled internally, not by the player, which is correct."
  },
  "actionImplementation": {
    "score": 2,
    "comments": "No 'action' commands (e.g., updatePlayerInfo, updateNPCInfo) are used to reflect state changes. This is a major schema and functional omission."
  },
  "immersion": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The narration maintains a strong sense of place and fantasy atmosphere throughout, using evocative language and sensory details to immerse the player in the cavern setting."

  "overallScore": 5,
  "strengths": [
    "Vivid, immersive narration and strong world-building.",
    "Correct internal handling of dice rolls for attacks.",
    "Logical initial tactics for NPC ally (Elara uses cover and ranged attack)."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Severe schema violations: missing required fields, presenting options for NPCs, and not using action commands for state changes.",
    "Turn order is not respected; player and NPC actions are conflated.",
    "No HP, condition, or inventory tracking; no mechanical resolution of attacks.",
    "No monster (Cave Troll) actions or tactical responses."
  ],
  "recommendedPromptImprovements": [
    "Explicitly instruct the AI to only present options to the player on their turn and to never process player actions during NPC turns.",
    "Require the AI to use 'action' commands (updatePlayerInfo, updateNPCInfo, etc.) for all state changes, including HP, conditions, and inventory.",
    "Mandate that all combat actions (attacks, damage, conditions) are resolved with appropriate dice rolls and state updates, and that these are reflected in the JSON output.",
    "Clarify that options should only be presented for the player character, not NPCs, and that NPC actions should be narrated and resolved automatically.",
    "Require that each combatant acts in strict initiative order, and that narration and state updates reflect this."
  ],
  "summary": "The AI delivers strong, immersive narration and handles attack rolls internally, but fails to adhere to key schema and combat management requirements. Turn order is not respected, state changes are not tracked or implemented, and action commands are missing. Improvements to schema enforcement, turn management, and state tracking are needed for robust, rules-compliant combat."
