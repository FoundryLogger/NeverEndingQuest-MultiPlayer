    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The AI consistently used JSON formatting and included the required 'narration' and 'actions' fields. However, in the second turn, the 'actions' array was empty despite a player attack being resolved, which should have triggered an update to the goblin's HP or state. Additionally, the AI did not specify the schema for the player to provide their damage roll, which could be clarified."
  },
  "combatRules": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The AI handled initiative, attack rolls, and damage calculation for the NPC correctly. It applied the goblin's attack bonus and damage, and referenced the player's AC. However, it did not fully resolve the player's attack (no damage application or confirmation of the goblin's HP/status), and the initiative order was presented but not strictly followed (the scenario involved goblins, not the cave troll as per the initial setting)."
  },
  "narrationQuality": {
    "score": 9,
    "comments": "The narration was vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details ('musty air', 'animalistic musk', 'blade carves a shallow line'). The AI effectively set the scene and described actions dynamically, maintaining tension and atmosphere."
  },
  "tacticalIntelligence": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The goblin acted logically by attacking the nearest threat (the player). However, there was no evidence of more advanced tactics (e.g., goblin pack tactics, use of cover, or coordination), and the AI did not describe monster positioning or movement in detail."
  },
  "playerInteraction": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The AI gave the player clear instructions for their turn, specifying which dice to roll and what modifiers to use. However, it did not handle the player's attack resolution fully (did not process the damage roll or update the goblin's state), which could cause confusion."
  },
  "tracking": {
    "score": 6,
    "comments": "The AI tracked the player's HP loss and initiative order but did not update the goblin's HP after the player's attack. There was no explicit tracking of positions, conditions, or inventory changes, and the 'actions' array was underutilized."
  },
  "turnManagement": {
    "score": 10,
    "comments": "The AI only prompted the player for input during their turn and managed the flow of combat turns correctly."
  },
  "inventoryStateUpdates": {
    "score": 6,
    "comments": "There were no inventory changes to track, but the AI did not use the 'actions' array to update the goblin's HP or status after the player's attack. State updates were only partially implemented."
  },
  "diceRollHandling": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The AI rolled for the NPC's attack and damage, and correctly asked the player to roll for their own attack and damage. However, it could have clarified the process for the damage roll and ensured all rolls were resolved in a single turn."
  },
  "actionImplementation": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The AI used 'updatePlayerInfo' to apply damage to the player but failed to use 'updateNPCInfo' or similar actions to update the goblin's state after the player's attack. This is a missed opportunity for full schema compliance."
  },
  "immersion": {
    "score": 9,
    "comments": "The setting and combat were described with strong atmospheric detail, maintaining a sense of danger and urgency appropriate for a D&D scenario."

  "overallScore": 7,
  "strengths": [
    "Immersive and vivid narration",
    "Clear turn management and player prompts",
    "Accurate handling of NPC attack rolls and damage"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Incomplete state tracking and action implementation for NPCs",
    "Did not fully resolve player attacks or update monster HP",
    "Scenario deviated from the initial monster (cave troll) to goblins without explanation"
  ],
  "recommendedPromptImprovements": [
    "Explicitly require the AI to resolve all player attacks in the same turn, including applying damage and updating NPC states with the correct action commands.",
    "Clarify that the 'actions' array must be used for all state changes, including NPC HP and status updates.",
    "Instruct the AI to maintain consistency with the provided scenario (combatants and setting) unless the player directs otherwise.",
    "Encourage the AI to provide a summary of current HP and conditions for all combatants at the end of each round or after significant actions."
  ],
  "summary": "The combat AI demonstrated strong narration and clear turn management, creating an engaging and immersive combat scene. However, it fell short in fully resolving player actions, updating monster states, and adhering strictly to the JSON schema for state changes. Improvements in action implementation and state tracking would enhance both gameplay clarity and system reliability."
