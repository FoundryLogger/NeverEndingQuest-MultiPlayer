    "score": 6,
    "comments": "The AI used a JSON object with 'narration' and 'actions' fields, but the 'actions' array was always empty, even when state changes (such as initiative, attack rolls, or HP changes) should have been tracked. The schema was superficially correct but lacked the required action commands (e.g., updateNPCInfo, updatePlayerInfo) for state updates."

  "combatRules": {
    "score": 6,
    "comments": "The AI handled initiative and attack rolls for the wolves and correctly applied attack bonuses. However, it failed to track or update HP, did not roll for damage itself, and asked the player to roll for damage, which is against the prompt. The encounter also used wolves instead of the specified Cave Troll, deviating from the scenario."
  },
  "narrationQuality": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "Descriptions were vivid and engaging, with atmospheric details about the cavern and dynamic combat narration. The AI maintained a strong sense of place and tension throughout the exchange."
  },
  "tacticalIntelligence": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The wolves attempted to flank and attack logically, showing some tactical awareness. However, the AI did not use the specified monster (Cave Troll), which would have required different tactics."
  },
  "playerInteraction": {
    "score": 7,
    "comments": "The AI prompted the player for their AC and attack roll at appropriate times, and responded to player actions with clear narration. However, it incorrectly asked the player to roll for damage, and did not provide clear options for other possible actions."
  },
  "tracking": {
    "score": 4,
    "comments": "There was no evidence of HP tracking, initiative order display, or updates to combatant states. The 'actions' field was unused, and no state changes were reflected in the output."
  },
  "turnManagement": {
    "score": 9,
    "comments": "The AI only asked for player input on the player's turn and did not prompt for input during NPC/monster turns. This aspect was handled well."
  },
  "inventoryStateUpdates": {
    "score": 4,
    "comments": "No inventory or resource tracking was present. The AI did not update or reference any changes to player or NPC inventory, nor did it use the appropriate action commands for state updates."
  },
  "diceRollHandling": {
    "score": 3,
    "comments": "The AI rolled for NPC attacks but asked the player to roll for their own damage, which is against the prompt's instruction that the AI should handle all dice rolls. This is a significant rules violation."
  },
  "actionImplementation": {
    "score": 2,
    "comments": "The AI never used the required 'action' commands (e.g., updatePlayerInfo, updateNPCInfo) to reflect state changes. The 'actions' array was always empty, even when state updates were warranted."
  },
  "immersion": {
    "score": 8,
    "comments": "The AI maintained a strong sense of atmosphere with evocative descriptions of the environment and combat. The world felt alive and dangerous, enhancing immersion."

  "overallScore": 5,
  "strengths": [
    "Vivid and immersive narration",
    "Logical monster tactics and turn management",
    "Clear prompts for player action"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Did not use required action commands for state updates",
    "Failed to handle all dice rolls as per prompt",
    "Did not track or update HP, initiative, or inventory",
    "Used incorrect monsters for the scenario"
  ],
  "recommendedPromptImprovements": [
    "Explicitly require the AI to use action commands for every state change (HP, position, inventory, etc.)",
    "Clarify that the AI must handle all dice rolls, including player damage, and never ask the player to roll",
    "Emphasize the importance of using the specified monsters and scenario details",
    "Require the AI to display initiative order and combatant HP after each round or significant event"
  ],
  "summary": "The AI delivered engaging narration and managed turn-taking well, but failed to adhere to critical system requirements such as state tracking, dice roll handling, and use of the specified scenario. Improvements are needed in schema adherence, action command usage, and strict rules compliance to ensure a robust and accurate combat simulation."
