She gestures around the shop, then points out the window toward the morning-lit village.\n\n\"Let me lay out the heart of Harrow's Hollow for you, Norn--especially now, when you've done so much for us. There's the General Store, where you're standing now, the hub of supplies and trade. Step outside and you're in the Town Square--folk meet there, post news, or gather for festivals when there's joy to be had. Eastward, you'll find the Guardhouse and the old gate--our first and last defense, should trouble come knocking. Just beyond that, the Militia Barracks. Modest, but it's where our watch rests, and where plans are made to keep the peace. Finally, the Wyrd Lantern Inn--good food, better drink, and a place to rest your head--or hear the latest rumors by firelight.\"\n\nShe pauses, her gaze lingering on you. \"Each place has its own folk, stories, and scars, Norn. And truth told, you'll find both thanks and new troubles waiting--folk haven't forgotten your deeds. If you'd like directions, or if you're curious about a particular place, just say the word.\"\n\nMirna's words hang in the air, her tone making it clear you are welcome wherever you choose to go. The village feels poised for change--and you sense that your next steps might shape its future.[0m",

The low murmur of morning trade fades as you focus, scanning for anything that might serve as a guide to Harrow's Hollow or reveal its key locations.\n\nThere are missing pet notices, a call for help with spring planting, and a half-torn flyer advertising the Wyrd Lantern Inn's stew night. One broad, yellowed sheet catches your eye: a rough hand-drawn map of the village, complete with childlike illustrations for each landmark. The general store, town square, militia barracks, east gate and guardhouse, and the Wyrd Lantern Inn are each marked with little sketches--a storefront, a fountain, a squat stone building, a gate, and a lantern-lit inn, respectively. The map is smudged but clear enough to follow, and someone has scrawled helpful notes beside each spot: 'Store: Ask Mirna for deals,' 'Square: Notices/meetings,' 'Barracks: Talk to Soren,' 'Gate: Watch duty,' and 'Inn: Cira's famous ale.'\n\nNo pamphlets or formal guides are in sight, but this board seems to hold all the knowledge a newcomer might need--if they're willing to piece it together.\n\nAs you study the board, Elder Mirna glances over with a wry smile. \"Folk around here prefer ink and tack to fancy signposts, but that old map's saved more than one traveler from wandering in circles. If you're thinking of visiting somewhere specific, let me know and I'll point you true.\"\n\nYou now have a clearer sense of the town's layout.
