# Keep of Doom Campaign - Verification Report

This document summarizes the compatibility check between the original area (HH001) and newly created areas (G001, SK001, TCD001, TBM001) to ensure consistent game mechanics and structure.

## Summary of Findings

The files generally follow a consistent structure and share compatible mechanics. The new areas maintain the established patterns for locations, connections, NPCs, monsters, and interactive elements. A few minor inconsistencies were identified but don't impact core functionality.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. JSON Schema/Structure Consistency

**Finding**: All area files follow the same basic structure with areaId, areaName, areaType, areaDescription, map, locations, etc. The hierarchical organization is consistent.

**Minor Variations**:
- Monster definitions vary slightly between areas:
  - Some use a simple empty array `"monsters": []`
  - Others use a more detailed format with number/disposition/strategy
  - Both formats are valid and can be handled by the game system

### 2. Location IDs and References

**Finding**: Location IDs are consistently formatted as "R01", "R02", etc. in all area files.

**Minor Variations**:
- Area connectivity references follow a consistent pattern
- All critical cross-area references use the proper "AREAID-LOCATIONID" format (e.g., "G001-R01")

### 3. Door/Trap Mechanisms

**Finding**: Door and trap structures are consistent across all files.

**Extensions**:
- New areas expand the available door types beyond those in HH001:
  - HH001 primarily uses: "regular", "heavy"
  - New areas add: "broken", "hidden", "warded", "gate", etc.
  - These expansions add variety without breaking compatibility

### 4. NPC Formats

**Finding**: NPC structures are consistent across all files, with each having name, description, and attitude attributes.

**No Issues Found**.

### 5. Connection Mechanisms

**Finding**: Area connections are consistently defined both within areas (connectivity) and between areas (areaConnectivity/areaConnectivityId).

**Confirmed**:
- All cross-area connections are bidirectional
- Entry/exit points between areas are logically consistent

### 6. Naming Conventions

**Finding**: Naming conventions for IDs, locations, and features are consistent across all files.

**No Issues Found**.

### 7. Required Fields

**Finding**: All required fields are present in each area file.

**No Issues Found**.

## Progression Path

The campaign offers a logical progression path through interconnected areas:

1. **Harrow's Hollow (HH001)** - Starting village
2. **East Gate (R03)** → **Gloamwood Forest (G001)** - First wilderness area
3. **Keeper's Cottage (R07)** → **Shadowfall Keep (SK001)** - Main dungeon area
4. **Lord's Study (R07)** → **The Cursed Dungeons (TCD001)** - Deep dungeon area
5. **Keeper's Cottage (R07)** → **The Blighted Marches (TBM001)** - Optional high-level area

## Compatibility Conclusion

The newly created areas are fully compatible with the existing HH001 structure. The files maintain consistent patterns while adding appropriate extensions that enhance the campaign without breaking established mechanics.

All areas are properly interconnected, creating a cohesive progression from the starting village through increasingly dangerous locations, culminating in the confrontation with Sir Garran Vael and the shadow relic in the Relic Chamber.
