Weapon racks line the walls, most empty but some still holding corroded halberds and crossbows. A heavy wooden table dominates the center, covered with faded duty rosters, stained playing cards, and a crudely scratched map revealing a secret passage to the Forgotten Ossuary. Arrow slits in one wall allowed guards to fire upon trouble in connecting corridors. Several cots remain in various states of decay along the back wall, and a small shrine to forgotten gods of order and justice stands here, now cleansed and restored, its holy presence dispelling lingering shadows. The ceiling is lower here than in other chambers, creating a sense of claustrophobia, and supporting pillars cast distinctive cross-shaped shadows regardless of light source position. A barred gate designed to control access stands partially open, its mechanism long since failed. The chamber bears signs of recent combat, but the threat has been eliminated. The room is now steeped in quiet relief and a hard-won peace following the party's victory over the curse that plagued the keep. Gentle morning light filters through a high window, illuminating the restored shrine where Scout Elen offers healing aid to Norn. The party has taken a short rest here, recovering strength and reflecting on their journey.",

Elen, seated on an old bench, expressed gratitude for the respite and offered healing aid to Norn by casting Cure Wounds thrice, each casting restoring substantial hit points and consuming her first-level spell slots. Initially, there was some confusion regarding Elen's available spell slots, but upon careful recounting, it was confirmed she retained some first-level and all second-level spell slots, allowing her to perform one final healing before her first-level slots were mostly spent. The party then took a short rest near the shrine, using the time to recover and reflect. During this pause, Elen shared her harrowing journey into the dungeons--slipping past wards aided by a bronze key from Mirna, evading relentless shadowy hunters, and following cryptic clues left by the Scribe until she reached the relic chamber before being saved by the party's intervention. Norn acknowledged that hope in Elen's survival had driven him onward through the darkness, strengthening their bond. As they prepared to depart, both acknowledged their shared endurance and the promise of returning to the surface, expressing eagerness for warmth, food, and normalcy. With the Guard Post peaceful and no active threats or traps present, the party stood ready to move toward the Gaol and onward to the trailhead gate, leaving behind the silent, hallowed halls that bore the marks of their trials.",
