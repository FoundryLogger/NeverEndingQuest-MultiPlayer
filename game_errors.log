I ask Elder Mirna, "Please, could you tell me specifically what the bronze key with the faded raven sigil opens?"
2025-05-24 12:19:48 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: Repeated attempts to ask Elder Mirna about the bronze key with the faded raven sigil have not elicited a response. I will try a different approach.

I say to Elder Mirna, "Could you please tell me about any locked doors or chests in Harrow's Hollow that might be opened by a bronze key with a faded raven sigil?"
2025-05-24 12:20:22 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: The DM repeated the previous dialogue instead of responding to my travel and search command. I will try a different phrasing.

I leave Elder Mirna's home and walk to the first location in Harrow's Hollow. Upon arrival, I carefully examine the surroundings, looking for anything of interest or hidden. I also search for any NPCs to speak with.
2025-05-24 12:20:29 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: The game does not acknowledge the arrival or allow interaction at the first location in Harrow's Hollow.

I say to Elder Mirna: "Thank you for that information about the raven door and the key. However, could you please provide me with a clear list of the five key locations in Harrow's Hollow, including their names, precise locations, and significance, so I can visit them systematically?"
2025-05-24 12:20:49 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: Repeated requests to Elder Mirna for the five key locations yield no direct list or clear details on the five locations. The responses have not provided the requested explicit list with names, precise locations, and significance.

Instead, it repeated a general description of the store and Elder Mirna without progressing the objective.

I will retry with a focused, step-by-step request:

I ask Elder Mirna Harrow about the bronze key, its significance, and whether it might open the storeroom door. Then, I carefully examine the notice board for any additional clues or quests. Next, I inspect the hooded lantern, rations, and leather pouch with the raven sigil on the shelves for descriptions and potential uses. Finally, I

I say to Elder Mirna Harrow, "Please, Elder Mirna, grant me permission to use the bronze key to open the storeroom door and investigate its contents."
2025-05-24 16:20:51 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: The response repeated the initial scene description instead of answering the vendor about the four locations in Harrow's Hollow. I will try rephrasing my question to the vendor to request information about the other four locations explicitly. 

I say to the vendor: "Please tell me the names and directions of the other four locations in Harrow's Hollow so I can visit each of them."

I will now change approach.

I say aloud, "Elder Mirna, if you cannot come with me, can you at least tell me more about the old keep and any dangers I should expect?"
2025-05-24 16:23:49 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: Elder Mirna does not respond with the remaining four locations when asked repeatedly. I will try a different approach.

I ask Elder Mirna, "Can you tell me about the main places in Harrow's Hollow I should visit to understand the village better?"

Since I intended to proceed to Greymont Keep, I will clarify to the DM:

"I intend to proceed to the Greymont Keep as the next location in Harrow's Hollow. Could you please confirm that this location is accessible? If it is known by another name or requires a specific action to reach, kindly advise so I can continue accordingly."

"It seems there is an issue reaching the keep at this time. While I wait for the path to open or for further instructions, I will remain vigilant here in Harrow's Hollow. If there are other locations I must visit first or preparations to make, please let me know. I do not wish to rush blindly into danger without proper guidance."

Since direct entry is blocked, I will reconsider my approach.

I step back from the gate and thoroughly examine the surrounding area--looking for side entrances, windows, or any clues that might reveal an alternate way inside the keep. I also scan for any signs of wards, salt circles, or iron implements nearby that Mara mentioned.

If nothing obvious appears, I will speak aloud, maintaining my respectful tone despite my frustration: "If the main gate is barred by forces unseen, perhaps the keep itself wishes its secrets guarded. I will seek another path or clue that might grant me entry without disturbing the wards prematurely."

I remain alert and proceed carefully around the perimeter, hoping to find a way forward that honors the warnings and keeps me safe.

If there are other locations in Harrow's Hollow I should visit or preparations I can make, please advise so I may continue effectively."
