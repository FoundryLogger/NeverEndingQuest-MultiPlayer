2025-05-23 12:42:43 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: No response from the shopkeeper was provided in the context. 

I will try a different approach: I ask the shopkeeper, "Could you please tell me about the locations in Harrow's Hollow? I want to visit all important places."

2025-05-24 12:19:34 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: Elder Mirna did not respond to my specific question about the bronze key with the faded raven sigil. I will try rephrasing my question to prompt a direct answer.

I ask Elder Mirna, "Please, could you tell me specifically what the bronze key with the faded raven sigil opens?"
2025-05-24 12:19:48 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: Repeated attempts to ask Elder Mirna about the bronze key with the faded raven sigil have not elicited a response. I will try a different approach.

I say to Elder Mirna, "Could you please tell me about any locked doors or chests in Harrow's Hollow that might be opened by a bronze key with a faded raven sigil?"
2025-05-24 12:20:22 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: The DM repeated the previous dialogue instead of responding to my travel and search command. I will try a different phrasing.

I leave Elder Mirna's home and walk to the first location in Harrow's Hollow. Upon arrival, I carefully examine the surroundings, looking for anything of interest or hidden. I also search for any NPCs to speak with.
2025-05-24 12:20:29 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: The game does not acknowledge the arrival or allow interaction at the first location in Harrow's Hollow. Attempting an alternative approach: "I ask a local or use a map to identify the exact location names and directions within Harrow's Hollow before proceeding."

2025-05-24 12:20:42 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: Elder Mirna provides detailed lore about the bronze key and the raven door but does not list the five key locations in Harrow's Hollow with their names, precise locations, and significance as requested.

I say to Elder Mirna: "Thank you for that information about the raven door and the key. However, could you please provide me with a clear list of the five key locations in Harrow's Hollow, including their names, precise locations, and significance, so I can visit them systematically?"
2025-05-24 12:20:49 - WARNING - AI reported issue: ISSUE DETECTED: Repeated requests to Elder Mirna for the five key locations yield no direct list or clear details on the five locations. The responses have not provided the requested explicit list with names, precise locations, and significance.

I will try a different approach:

I say to Elder Mirna: "Please name each of the five key locations in Harrow's Hollow, one by one, starting with their name, where exactly they are in the village, and why they matter."
