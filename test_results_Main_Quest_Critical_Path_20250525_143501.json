Her eyes narrow thoughtfully, and she leans in, lowering her voice so only you can hear. \"Well now, Norn, that's a straight question and no mistake. Most folk are still on edge after all that's happened with the keep, but you know how a small place is--trouble sprouts as quick as mushrooms after rain.\"\n\nShe glances toward the dusty shelves, as if weighing her words. \"With the curse lifted, folks are daring to poke their noses out again. Mirna, our elder, has had her hands full--there's talk she's hoping someone will look into the old mill by the river. The gears keep turning at night, though no one's set foot there since before the troubles. Some say it's just the wind... but others hear voices.\"\n\nHilda purses her lips. \"Then there's Old Tommen. Claims he's seen lights in the graveyard after dark--says the spirits aren't at rest, even now. Most take his tales with a pinch of salt, but if you ask me, there's often a kernel of truth underneath.\"\n\nShe straightens, voice returning to its usual briskness. \"If you're looking to help, Mirna in the town square would be your best start--she keeps track of what needs doing. Or you could check on the inn; Cira's been worried about something in her cellar again.\"\n\nHilda gives you a small, grateful smile. \"Folk remember who stands up for them, Norn. Harrow's Hollow owes you more than we can ever say, but we won't turn away a willing hand.\"\n\nThe sun creeps a little higher outside, and the bustle of the village seems to grow, as if hope is returning with the daylight. What will you do next?",
      "ai_action": "Documented quest information from Hilda Cobbler:\n\n- Main quest lead: Elder Mirna in the town square has tasks related to the old mill by the river, where mysterious mechanical noises and voices have been reported at night. This is likely the primary quest.\n- Additional rumors: Old Tommen reports lights in the graveyard after dark, possibly a side investigation or flavor content.\n- Another potential task: Cira at the inn is worried about something in her cellar.\n\nNext action: I will go directly to Elder Mirna in the town square to get the official quest.\n\nNorn leaves the general store and makes his way promptly to the town square to seek out Elder Mirna. Upon arrival, I will ask Elder Mirna if she has any tasks or quests that need help, specifically mentioning the old mill to confirm the quest details.",

Crossing the muddy lane, you make your way toward the heart of Harrow's Hollow--the town square. As you approach, the familiar sight of Elder Mirna comes into view. She stands near the ancient stone well, her posture straight despite her years, silver hair braided and pinned neatly beneath a plain scarf.\n\nA few villagers gather nearby, their voices hushed with a blend of gratitude and lingering unease. Mirna turns at the sound of your approach, her weathered face lighting with a warm, relieved smile. \"Norn,\" she greets, her voice carrying the quiet authority of someone who's steered the village through more storms than most can count. \"You've done more for us than any could hope. Still, peace is a fragile thing in Harrow's Hollow.\"\n\nWhen you mention the old mill, Mirna's expression sobers. She gently ushers you aside, lowering her voice. \"The mill's been... restless. The gears turn at night--no wind, no hand upon them. Folk who live nearby hear voices: whispers and weeping, sometimes laughter that doesn't sound quite right. I daren't send anyone alone, not after what we've all seen.\"\n\nShe folds her hands. \"If you would look into it, Norn, the village would rest easier. No one knows what lies within; perhaps some remnant of the curse, or simply a sorrowful spirit clinging to the past. Either way, I trust your judgment.\"\n\nMirna glances upward, as if weighing the weight of her years. \"You should know: the mill was abandoned before the troubles even began. If anything unusual remains, it may be tied to the keep--or to those who vanished. Bring me word of what you find, and if you can, lay whatever haunts it to rest.\"\n\nThe square bustles around you, but you feel a sense of purpose settle over the morning. The path to the old mill lies beyond the east gate, winding through tangled brush toward the banks of the river. Mirna offers a grateful nod. \"Anything you need to prepare, you know where to find me. The village stands behind you.\"\n\nWill you set out for the old mill now, Norn, or do you wish to prepare further before facing whatever lingers in its shadow?",

The scent of damp earth grows stronger, mingling with the faint, oily aroma of abandoned machinery.\n\nThe old mill rises ahead, its wooden frame leaning precariously over the churning waters of the river. Though the water wheel is still, the upper windows glint with the reflection of the morning sun--and something about their darkness suggests secrets waiting inside. As you draw closer, a chill runs down your spine; the air is heavy, as if holding its breath. For a moment, you think you hear the low, rhythmic creak of unseen gears turning beyond the walls, though not a soul is in sight.\n\nYou now stand before the old mill, the door slightly ajar and the river murmuring at your back. The haunting silence is broken only by the sigh of the wind through broken shutters and, somewhere deep within, a faint, sorrowful moan.\n\nWill you brave the darkness and enter the mill, or take a moment to observe your surroundings before proceeding?

This persistent error likely causes QUEST_TRACKING_FAIL bugs or quest log inconsistencies.\n\nDespite the error, the game allows movement and scene progression.\n\nTesting notes:\n- Quest objectives for investigating the mill remain active and clear.\n- Location transitions are visually and narratively functional, but summary updates fail.\n- No immediate progression blockers beyond summary script failure.\n\nNext test: Proceed to the abandoned mill entrance once again to verify if any quest progression or triggers activate despite the summary errors.\n\nNorn continues straight down the Witchlight Trailhead, heading directly to the mill entrance to investigate and attempt to trigger quest events.",
