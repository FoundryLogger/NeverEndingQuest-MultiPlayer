Wooden shelves sag under the weight of salted meats, sacks of flour, and modest supplies--lantern oil, rope, simple tools, and a handful of dusty trinkets that might catch the eye of a desperate adventurer. The faint scent of beeswax and dried herbs lingers in the air.\n\nThrough the frosted front window, you glimpse the overcast morning outside--a gray sky that presses down on the quiet village. The world is hushed, as if holding its breath. From behind the counter, old Mistress Della, the shopkeeper, gives you a thin smile. Her hands are busy folding muslin cloth, but her eyes are sharp and watchful.\n\n\"Morning, Norn,\" she says, voice as creaky as the floorboards. \"You're up early. Word is you've been dealing with those peculiar happenings out by the edge of the woods. You look like you could use something strong--tea or otherwise. Anything you need before you head out again?\"\n\nThe store is quiet, its shelves offering only the essentials. There are no other customers, and outside, the Hollow remains subdued--its usual bustle dampened by the recent troubles. The faint toll of the distant bell marks the hour: 8 o'clock.\n\nDella raises an eyebrow as she awaits your reply. Perhaps you wish to purchase supplies, ask after the latest rumors, or simply take a moment to gather your thoughts before venturing forth once more. What will you do?",

Her brow furrows, and she leans in, lowering her voice as if the shadows in the corners might be listening.\n\n\"Well, Norn, it warms my heart to see a young soul still eager for honest work and not just glory,\" she says, voice tinged with gratitude. \"Truth be told, after all that's happened, folks in the Hollow are slow to trust strangers, and most are keeping to their own. But... there are always needs, big and small.\"\n\nShe glances to the side, hesitating. \"With the curse lifted, folk are hoping for brighter days, but not all wounds heal quick. My cousin, Old Tommen, swears he's still seen shadows moving by the old well at dusk. Swears it's the wandering spirit again--he's certain of it. If you're willing to lend an ear to an old man's ramblings, maybe you could help lay his mind to rest.\"\n\nDella's eyes flit toward the door, voice softening. \"And--well--supplies have been running thin, and the last few deliveries from the outlying farms haven't come. We're short on dried mushrooms and wild honey. If you're headed toward the edge of the woods again, maybe you could ask after the farmers, see if they're safe.\"\n\nShe offers a wry smile. \"Help enough folk here, and I'll wager you'll never pay a copper for bread or stew again. The Hollow remembers its friends. If you want more specifics, you might check with Elder Mirna in the Town Square or Cira at the inn. Both keep their ears close to the ground, if you catch my meaning.\"\n\nDella folds her hands, meeting your gaze. \"So, Norn--will you look into Old Tommen's ghost, the missing farmers, or perhaps speak to the others for more work? Or maybe you'd rather rest for a spell and take stock of your supplies?\"",

The heavy clouds cast the village in a silvery gloom, but the air is alive with the subtle stirrings of new hope--a sense that, with the worst behind, life might yet return to normal in Harrow's Hollow.\n\nYour boots thud against the cobbled path as you cross from the general store toward the Town Square. The square itself is the heart of the Hollow: an open space ringed by low timbered buildings, with a weathered well at its center and the faded banners of past festivals fluttering halfheartedly in the breeze.\n\nA pair of villagers, bundled in plain cloaks, pause in their morning chores to greet you.\n\n\"Looking for Elder Mirna, are you?\" says a wiry man, setting down a basket of early greens. \"She'll be by the old oak, speaking with Marshal Hobb. Can't miss the cane--and her voice carries like a crow in a church.\"\n\nYou follow his gesture to the broad oak that anchors one edge of the square. There, Elder Mirna--her stooped frame draped in a blue shawl--stands deep in conversation with the town's marshal. She notices your approach and lifts her chin, a gentle but commanding presence in the modest crowd.\n\nAs you draw near, Marshal Hobb gives you a respectful nod before stepping aside. Elder Mirna fixes you with her keen, appraising gaze. \"Norn,\" she says, her tone warm but businesslike, \"you've returned to us in one piece, and with our thanks. I trust Della sent you my way. Is it new trouble on your mind, or are you here for the rewards owed--and perhaps more besides?\"\n\nThe villagers nearby look up, attentive.

Her tone grows more confidential. \"There are two matters that weigh on me, and I'd name them quests if you'll have them:\n\nFirst, Old Tommen, our well-watcher, claims the spirit that haunted him before has returned--restless and moaning by the well at dusk. He's frightened, and the folk are spooked too. If you can uncover the truth or lay the shade to rest, you'd bring peace to a troubled soul and the Hollow besides.\n\nSecond, we've had no word from the farms out past the wood since the curse was lifted. Our supplies run thin. If you could check on the farmers--see they're safe, and learn why the deliveries have stopped--we'd all rest easier.\"\n\nMirna fixes you with a pointed look. \"Take up either task, both, or none at all. But know that helping us now will not be forgotten. And should you need more detail, Tommen himself is by the well most afternoons, and Mistress Della keeps track of the storehouse and who's overdue.\"\n\nShe waits, hope and worry mingling in her gaze. \"Will you accept one of these quests, Norn?
