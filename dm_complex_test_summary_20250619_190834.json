Player: I want to give Elen a potion of healing and 50 gold, then have her cast a spell to detect magic on my sword. While she's doing that, I'll update my journal about finding a mysterious symbol in the ruins. Also, we found a hidden compartment with a magical tome that teaches the Shield spell - I want to learn it. Oh, and 2 hours pass during all this. Update the plot to reflect we discovered clues about an ancient curse affecting the village. Finally, I think I've earned enough XP to level up!",
