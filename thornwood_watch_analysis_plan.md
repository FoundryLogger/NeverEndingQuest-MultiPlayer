# Thornwood Watch Module Analysis Plan

## Objective
Analyze the newly created Thornwood Watch module structure and content to evaluate how well the AI implemented the module design.

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Area Files Structure (TOG001.json, TD001.json, NR001.json)
- Location count per area (should be 5 each)
- NPC distribution and placement
- Area connectivity and flow
- Content quality and descriptions

### 2. Elen's Role and Positioning
- Verify she appears as a commander who stays at her post
- Check her dialogue and interactions
- Ensure proper characterization from original design

### 3. Linear Progression Structure
- Verify linear path rather than hub-and-spoke
- Check area connections and flow
- Validate progression logic

### 4. Module Plot Structure
- Compare against original design goals
- Check plot progression mechanics
- Verify story coherence

### 5. Keep of Doom Connection
- Verify proper setup for next module
- Check story hooks and continuity

### 6. Technical Validation
- Schema compliance
- Missing elements identification
- File structure validation
