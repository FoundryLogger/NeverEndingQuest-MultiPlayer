The room was dimly lit by flickering lanterns, casting eerie shadows that danced across the cluttered workbenches. As Norn moved further into the workshop, he noticed a peculiar contraption resembling a mechanical spider, its legs twitching as if attempting to come to life. The air was thick with tension, and the hum of machinery created an almost oppressive atmosphere. In the far corner, Fiddlebit, the gnome inventor, was deeply engrossed in his latest creation, oblivious to the adventurer's presence. Norn's sudden, forceful entrance startled Fiddlebit, causing him to drop a delicate gear he had been meticulously adjusting. The gnome looked up, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and annoyance. Norn's aggressive demeanor and the sight of the trembling Gnome Greeter, who Norn had dragged in by the collar, quickly conveyed the gravity of the situation. Under duress, Fiddlebit hesitantly revealed the secrets behind his latest invention, explaining its intended purpose and potential dangers. Norn's menacing interrogation yielded critical information about the device's weaknesses and how it could be safely deactivated. The encounter concluded with Norn leaving the workshop, the Gnome Greeter left behind nursing his bruised cheek, and Fiddlebit visibly shaken but cooperative. The workshop, once a place of innovation and creativity, now felt tainted by the violence and fear that had transpired within its walls."

However, the situation escalated when Norn, in a fit of frustration, swept his arm across a workbench, causing fragile components to crash to the ground with a cacophony of shattering glass and breaking metal. The noise heightened the tension, and both gnomes winced in palpable fear. Desperate to avoid further destruction, Fibblestib revealed that a malfunctioning machine in the workshop, a creation gone awry, might be linked to the kings' disappearance and begged for the adventurers' help to stop it. With the gnomes now extremely fearful and cooperative out of necessity, Norn instructed them to stay in the workshop as he headed back into the Welcome Chamber, leaving behind a strained relationship and a workshop in disarray."

Norn demanded answers about the kings' disappearance, prompting Fibblestib to reveal that the kings vanished after a new invention malfunctioned. He pointed to a large, complex machine in the corner, indicating it might be related to their disappearance but was too unstable to approach. Norn decided to investigate the machine, identifying a control panel, an energy core, and runic seals as the sources of its instability. With a successful series of checks, he recalibrated the control panel and stabilized the energy core, neutralizing the immediate danger. This action completed the investigation of the workshop and revealed that the unstable machine might have transported the kings to another location within Gnomengarde. In a hidden compartment, Norn found a Wand of Magic Missiles and blueprints indicating the machine was designed for portal creation. The blueprints suggested further clues could be found in the Testing Chamber and Living Quarters. With this newfound information, Norn directed Fibblestib to follow him to the Testing Chamber to continue their search."

The long tables were neatly set but bore the signs of recent turmoil, with a few chairs out of place and minor wear and tear visible. Chef Nibblenock, who was initially cheerful, became somber as he recounted the mysterious events surrounding the disappearance of the kings during a recent feast. He explained that the kings had been acting unusually, as if under an enchantment, and had abruptly left the hall amid the celebration. As the adventurers searched the room for clues, they found a crumpled piece of parchment near one of the tables, which mentioned testing a new device and unexpected results. Further investigation revealed a faint, glittering residue on the floor, hinting at some sort of magical influence. Under a displaced chair, they discovered a small, intricately carved amulet, its design matching a key they had found earlier. Despite an attempt to identify the residue through arcane knowledge, its nature remained elusive, though its proximity to where the kings were last seen suggested its significance. Chef Nibblenock confirmed that the key and amulet were likely connected to the private chambers in the Testing Chamber, where more answers might be found. With these clues in hand, the adventurers decided to proceed to the Testing Chamber, hoping to uncover the truth behind the kings' strange behavior and sudden disappearance."

Despite his careful inspection and arcane assistance, his initial Investigation check failed to uncover the mechanism. Undeterred, Norn summoned a Mage Hand cantrip, directing the spectral hand to methodically probe the indentation and surrounding areas. This second, more precise Investigation revealed a small, hidden lever within the rock face. Upon triggering it, the illusory wall shimmered and faded, unveiling a narrow passageway into Gnomengarde.

Elara, with her keen senses, detected faint magical auras emanating from some of the artifacts, suggesting they were not merely decorative. Thalor examined the floor for traps, ensuring their safety as they navigated the chamber. The party decided to pull the lever, which revealed a concealed door leading further into Gnomengarde. This discovery suggested that the chamber was not only a place of welcome but also a gateway to deeper secrets. Before proceeding through the newly revealed passage, they took a moment to investigate the relics more closely, uncovering a few items of interest: a scroll with ancient gnome spells, a small but powerful enchanted amulet, and a beautifully crafted map of Gnomengarde.

As Gilly, Elara, Thalor, and Norn cautiously navigated the labyrinth of mechanical wonders, they noticed signs of recent activity: tools left in a hurry, and projects seemingly abandoned mid-creation. Their search revealed a hidden journal under a pile of schematics, detailing the gnome kings' last known experiments and strange occurrences in the workshop, such as unexplained malfunctions and haunting noises. Their investigation was abruptly interrupted by a sudden, loud crash from the far end of the workshop. A malfunctioning automaton, likely one of the kings' unfinished inventions, had come to life, its movements erratic and dangerous. In a swift and coordinated effort, the party managed to disable the automaton, though not without sustaining minor injuries. This encounter confirmed their suspicions of a deeper mystery at play, compelling them to further investigate the peculiar circumstances surrounding the gnome kings' disappearance."

The implications of this discovery were significant, suggesting both potential danger and opportunity deeper within the mines. The party pocketed the gold and documents, their minds racing with the possibilities of what the Deep Vein could hold. The information gathered added a new layer of intrigue to their quest, and with their findings secured, they prepared to move on, leaving the abandoned office behind."

Thalor, ever cautious, moved to check the sturdiness of the walls and ceiling, noting the precarious state of the support beams.\n\nThe ledger revealed records of mining operations, detailing shipments of ore and the workers' names, but more intriguingly, it referenced a series of accidents and mysterious disappearances that had plagued the mine before it was abandoned. As they delved deeper into the records, the party's attention was drawn to a mention of an unexplored shaft that might hold clues to the mine's eerie past.\n\nSuddenly, a loud creak echoed through the office, causing everyone to freeze. The sound of shifting weight and the groan of old wood made it clear that the structure was unstable. Deciding it was too risky to linger, Norn signaled for the group to exit, but not before Gilly tore out the most relevant pages from the ledger for further study.
