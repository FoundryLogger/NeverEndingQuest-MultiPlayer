# Tool Command Names
When using command line tools, use these specific command names:
- Use `fdfind` instead of `fd` for file searching
- Use `batcat` instead of `bat` for syntax-highlighted file viewing
- Use `rg` for ripgrep (fast text search)
- All other tools use their standard names: `jq`, `tree`, `fzf`, `black`, `flake8`, `pytest`, `mypy`
