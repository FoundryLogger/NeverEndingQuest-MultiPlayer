# Combat System Test Analysis

## Test Scenarios Created

### 1. **Basic Combat Initialization Test**
- **Purpose**: Verify AI waits for player confirmation and uses new format
- **Key Points**:
  - Provides prerolled dice pools
  - Sets up simple 1v1 combat
  - Tests if AI asks for player action instead of assuming

### 2. **Player Action Processing Test**
- **Purpose**: Verify correct preroll usage and full round completion
- **Key Points**:
  - Tests sequential dice usage (d20[0]=15, d8[0]=4)
  - Verifies damage calculation
  - Checks if AI completes full round (Shadow's turn)

### 3. **Validation System Test**
- **Purpose**: Ensure validation catches errors with detailed explanations
- **Key Points**:
  - Dead skeleton (0 HP) attempting to attack
  - Tests new requirement for detailed validation reasons
  - Verifies specific rule violation identification

## Expected Improvements

### Before Our Changes:
1. **Preroll Confusion**: AI using wrong dice types (d20 for damage)
2. **Turn Skipping**: Not waiting for player confirmation
3. **Vague Validation**: "No reason provided" errors
4. **Round Tracking Issues**: Confusion between round tracking and combat flow

### After Our Changes:
1. **Clear Preroll Instructions**: 
   - d20 pool for ALL attacks/saves
   - Damage dice by weapon type
   - Sequential usage tracking

2. **Explicit Turn Confirmation**:
   - MUST ask player what to do
   - WAIT for response
   - Confirm action even with prerolls

3. **Detailed Validation**:
   - REQUIRED explanations
   - Specific rule violations
   - Clear recommendations

4. **Separated Concerns**:
   - `combat_round` field separate from narration
   - Reduces cognitive load
   - Clearer round progression

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Updated `combat_sim_prompt.txt` with simplified preroll instructions
- Added turn confirmation requirements
- Separated round tracking to its own JSON field
- Enhanced validation to require detailed explanations
- Verified combat_manager.py supports new format

## Test Results Summary

The changes should result in:
1. **More Consistent Preroll Usage**: AI follows clear pool-based instructions
2. **Better Turn Management**: Player always gets to confirm actions
3. **Improved Debugging**: Validation provides specific failure reasons
4. **Smoother Combat Flow**: Less confusion about round vs turn management

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Monitoring**: Watch for any edge cases where preroll pools run out
2. **Performance**: Ensure separated round tracking doesn't slow processing
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing encounters should still work
4. **User Experience**: Players should notice smoother, more predictable combat

The test scenarios are ready to validate these improvements in actual gameplay.
