Is it true they appear after dusk?\"\n\nElder Mirna's steady hands pause on her ledger. For a moment, the lines in her face deepen. She lowers her voice, mindful of prying ears. \"Folk say the lights are cold and pale, drifting between the trees on moonless nights. Sometimes...\" She hesitates, searching your face for judgment. \"Sometimes they move with purpose, almost like lanterns carried by unseen hands. One villager claimed to see shapes following--figures, thin as shadows.\"\n\nShe glances toward the shuttered windows. \"I've lived here all my days, Norn, and I know a frightened story from a real worry. These lights come and go, but they started again just before Scout Elen vanished. I'd wager the keep's curse is stirring, or worse. If you mean to look into it, you'll need your wits--and maybe something more.\"\n\nMirna's hand lingers near the shelf where you glimpsed the old bronze key, as if torn between warning and trust. \"If you want to learn more, you could speak to Old Tommen or brave the forest by night yourself. I'd not blame you for choosing caution, mind.\"\n\nShe holds your gaze, waiting--will you press her for more about the key, seek supplies, or pursue another lead?",

Does it have something to do with the keep, or these strange goings-on?\"\n\nMirna's fingers instinctively close around the key, her expression tightening just a touch. For a heartbeat, she seems about to deflect, but she sighs, weighing trust and caution. \"You're sharp-eyed, Norn. Most folks pay no mind to old trinkets. That key's been in my family since before the troubles began--passed down with little explanation, save that it's tied to the Greymont line and the keep itself. Folks say the raven was their crest.\"\n\nShe hesitates, searching your face for intent. \"There's more I could tell, but old oaths aren't easily set aside. This key's not just a relic--it might open doors better left closed. Still, if you truly aim to end these curses, perhaps... perhaps it's time someone braver than me took it.\"\n\nMirna studies you, eyes narrowed with hope and worry. \"If I entrust it to you, promise me this: use it only with wisdom, and never for greed.

The metal is cold, weighty with history, and the faded raven sigil is unmistakable. \"May the spirits watch over you, Norn,\" she murmurs. \"That key was meant for the keep's inner doors--perhaps more. I hope it serves you better than it did my kin.\"\n\nShe glances around to be sure no one else is listening, then adds in a quieter tone, \"If you seek the truth of what befell Harrow's Hollow, follow the key's path. And beware the shadows near the old chapel--some secrets linger best undisturbed.\"\n\nAs you slip the bronze key into your pack, Mirna straightens, her composure returning. \"Supplies are yours at a fair price, should you need them.
