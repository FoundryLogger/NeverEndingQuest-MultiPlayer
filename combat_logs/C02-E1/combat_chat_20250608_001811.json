The armor, animated by ancient magic, launched a multiattack but failed to prevent Norn from striking decisively with two powerful longsword attacks. After a fierce exchange, Norn's precise strikes dealt a combined 17 damage, shattering the armor's defenses and reducing it from 8 HP to 0. The shattered, lifeless suit of armor collapsed onto the ground, leaving behind a battered corpse of ancient metal. With the guardian defeated, the oppressive atmosphere eased, marking a hard-fought victory for Norn. For this encounter, Norn is awarded 450 experience points.\",\n  \"combat_round\": 1,\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"characterName\": \"Norn\",\n        \"changes\": \"HP reduced by 7 from 33 to 26 due to armor's attacks; status alive; condition none\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateEncounter\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"encounterId\": \"GatehouseRuinsEncounter\",\n        \"changes\": \"Animated Armor takes 25 damage, HP from 33 to 8\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateEncounter\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"encounterId\": \"GatehouseRuinsEncounter\",\n        \"changes\": \"Animated Armor retaliates and deals 2 bludgeoning damage to Norn\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateEncounter\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"encounterId\": \"GatehouseRuinsEncounter\",\n        \"changes\": \"Animated Armor takes 17 damage, HP from 8 to 0 and is defeated; its shattered metal corpse lies motionless\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
