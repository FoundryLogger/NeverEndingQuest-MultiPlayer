Almost simultaneously, a scrappy goblin emerges on the other side, its scimitar drawn, sneer revealing sharp teeth as it assesses your group. The hidden entrance's silence breaks and the battle for the doorway begins.\\n\\nInitiative order has been determined as follows: Elara and the kobold act first, moving in tandem with a keen sense of urgency. Then comes Gilly's swift reflexes, followed closely by Norn's steady presence in the fray. Lastly, the goblin and Thalor anticipate their moments to strike.\\n\\nElara, with her sharp elf eyes, pulls an arrow from her quiver and takes aim at the kobold, needing to roll for her attack. Next, the kobold charges forward to retaliate, hoping to break your party's lines. With that in mind, would you like to direct Norn's initial combat action? Please specify your attack choice and prepare to roll a d20, adding your attack bonus of +5 for melee weapons or +4 for ranged.\",\n  \"actions\": []\n}"
