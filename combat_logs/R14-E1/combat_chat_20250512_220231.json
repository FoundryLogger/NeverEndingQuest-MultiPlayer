Their beady eyes gleam with hunger as they charge toward your party. The tension is thick as each combatant prepares to act. The initiative order starts with the swift giant rat, who darts forward with surprising speed. Thalor, the steadfast cleric, readies himself next, gripping his warhammer firmly. Gilly, ever nimble, positions herself carefully to strike where she can be most effective. Your turn will come shortly, so prepare yourself.\\n\\nStarting with the giant rat on initiative 18, it lunges directly at Thalor, sniffing the air aggressively. The rat bites with a quick snap. Rolling a d20 for the attack... it scores a 13 plus 4 attack bonus, totaling 17, which hits Thalor's armor class of 16. Rolling damage: 1d4 plus 2 bonus piercing damage... it deals 4 points of piercing damage to Thalor.\\n\\nThalor winces but stays resolute. He grips his warhammer tightly and swings at the giant rat. Rolling a d20 for attack... a 14 plus 4 attack bonus, total 18, hitting the rat's AC of 12. Now for damage: 1d8 plus 2... rolls a 6, total 8 damage. The rat squeals sharply, badly wounded.\\n\\nNext, Gilly flashes a mischievous grin as she aims her shortsword at the injured rat. She moves swiftly to a flank position. Rolling a d20 for attack... she gets a total of 19 with her attack bonus. That hits! Rolling damage: 1d6 plus 3, and sneak attack applies for an additional 2d6 since the rat is within 5 feet of Thalor. Damage rolls: shortsword 4 + 3 = 7 and sneak attack 5 + 6 = 11. Total damage: 18. The rat collapses, lifeless, under the coordinated attack.\\n\\nNow, Elara, with her keen senses, readies her longbow and takes aim at the second giant rat, which skitters forward. Rolling to hit... she scores a 15 plus 5, total 20, a solid hit. Damage: 1d8 plus 3, she rolls a 5 plus 3, totaling 8 damage to the rat. It's staggered but still standing.\\n\\nGiant rat 3 scurries up and attacks Gilly in retaliation. Rolling to hit... a 16 plus 4 is 20, hitting her AC of 15. Damage roll: 1d4 plus 2, roll is 2 plus 2, 4 damage. Gilly grimaces but remains agile.\\n\\nThe second giant rat, wounded but fierce, attacks Elara. Rolling d20 for attack... a 10 plus 4 equals 14, missing her AC of 15 by an inch.\\n\\nThe last giant rat runs forward, poised to strike but deciding to circle cautiously.\\n\\nNorn, your turn is next. The battlefield is alive with movement. Gilly says with a grin, 'Norn, those rats won't last long if you make your move count!' What will you do?
