The cramped space filled with shattered weapons and scorch marks offers little room to dodge their attacks. The tension is palpable as combat erupts.\\n\\nGilly, ever the quick and cunning rogue, lets out a low chuckle. \\\"Alright, let's see if these vermin know how to dance.\\\"\\n\\nShe darts forward quickly, aiming her shortsword at the nearest rat. Rolling a d20 for Gilly's attack... she scores an 18! Adding her +5 attack bonus, the total is 23, a clear hit on the giant rat's AC of 12. Rolling damage... 1d6+3, she rolls a 4 plus 3, dealing 7 piercing damage. The rat shrieks as the blade finds its mark, staggering but not down yet.\\n\\nBefore the rat can retaliate, Elara nocks an arrow, her keen elven eyes trained on the wounded beast. Rolling her d20 for the attack... a 14, plus 5 for a total of 19, hitting the same giant rat. Rolling damage... 1d8+3, a 5 plus 3, totaling 8 piercing damage. The rat lets out a final squeal before collapsing, lifeless.\\n\\nThalor steps up next, gripping his warhammer tightly. \\\"Stay close, friends.\\\"\\n\\nHe swings at the second giant rat that has just come within reach. Rolling d20 for Thalor's attack... a 12 plus 4, total 16, hitting the rat's AC. Damage roll... 1d8+2, he rolls 6 plus 2, for 8 bludgeoning damage. The second rat snarls, wounded but still fierce.\\n\\nThe second giant rat, enraged by the attacks, lunges at Thalor with bared teeth. Rolling attack... a 15 plus 4, total 19, which hits. Rolling damage... 1d4+2, rolls 3 + 2, dealing 5 piercing damage to Thalor. He grunts but remains steady.\\n\\nNow, the third giant rat, positioned between Elara and you, Norn, prepares to attack Elara, snarling fiercely. It lunges forward, rolling d20 for attack... 10 plus 4, total 14, just shy of Elara's AC 15 and misses its mark.\\n\\nYour turn, Norn. The battleground is tight, and two rats remain snarling and ready to fight. What will your action be?
