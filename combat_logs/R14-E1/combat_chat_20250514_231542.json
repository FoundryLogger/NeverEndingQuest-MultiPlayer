Suddenly, a rustling sound catches everyone's attention. From the shadows darts a Giant Rat, its beady eyes fixed on your group, ready to attack. The order of combat is ready: Elara, with her keen senses, acts first, followed closely by Gilly and the Giant Rat share the same initiative, then it's Norn's turn, with Thalor bringing up the rear.\\n\\nElara doesn't hesitate\u2014she swiftly draws her longbow and takes aim at the Giant Rat. Rolling a d20 for her attack... she rolls an 18! Adding her +5 attack bonus, that's a total of 23. A solid hit! She then rolls 1d8 for damage... rolling a 5, plus 3 for her damage bonus, makes 8 points of piercing damage. The arrow strikes the Giant Rat, piercing its hide and leaving it wounded.\\n\\nGilly, spotting the vulnerable rat, grins and readies her shortsword. \\\"Let me slip in a sneak attack,\\\" she says, darting closer. Rolling her attack... she rolls a 14 on the d20, adding her +5 bonus for 19 total, definitely hitting the rat. Rolling damage, 1d6 plus 3 gives her 7, then her Sneak Attack adds another 5 points of damage from 2d6. The total damage is 12 points piercing. The rat squeals sharply, now much worse off.\\n\\nNow, the Giant Rat, desperate, lunges at Gilly with its sharp teeth. The rat rolls its attack, a d20... it gets 14, plus 4 attack bonus equals 18. This hits Gilly's AC of 15. Rolling for damage, 1d4 plus 2... rolled a 3, plus 2, 5 piercing damage to Gilly. The rat jaws snap dangerously close.\\n\\nIt is your turn, Norn. The rat looks injured but still dangerous. What would you like to do? You can attack with any of your weapons. Please roll a d20 for your attack and add your attack bonus, which is +5 for melee weapons or +4 for your sturdy bow ranged attack.
