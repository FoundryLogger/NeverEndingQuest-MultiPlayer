The Dungeon Master should resolve the Giant Rat's attack (using the available preroll for its attack), apply any damage and update HP/status, then prompt Norn for their action. The current response skips the rat's turn and goes directly to the player, violating initiative order.\n\nThe Dungeon Master should process the Giant Rat's turn first: use the rat's attack preroll (Attack[6]), resolve the attack against Norn (AC 19), apply any damage using the appropriate preroll dice, update Norn's HP if hit, and narrate the outcome. Only after the rat's turn is complete should the narration prompt Norn for their action. Ensure all HP changes are immediately reflected in the narration and actions array..
