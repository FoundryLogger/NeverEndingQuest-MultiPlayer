Update Norn's HP from 23 to 12. 2) On the skeleton's turn, choose either shortsword or shortbow (not both), use the next available d20 (6 for shortsword), add attack bonus, and check against AC. If it misses, no damage. 3) After both monster turns, clearly state Norn's current HP and prompt for Norn's action. 4) Use 'updateCharacterInfo' for Norn's HP change, and 'updateEncounter' for monster HP/status changes if needed..
