Three successes mean you stabilize and stop making death saves, remaining unconscious but no longer dying. Three failures result in death. Any natural 20 on a death saving throw allows you to regain 1 hit point and regain consciousness immediately. If you take any damage while unconscious, you automatically fail a death saving throw, or take two failures if the damage is a critical hit. You can be stabilized by receiving healing from an ally, but until then, you must rely on these death saves. Your next turn, you will make the first death saving throw.

        "content": "Combat Summary: The encounter unfolded in the eerie Great Hall, where the party faced a dangerous mimic disguised as an ornate chair at the table's head. Norn, maintaining steady resolve, initiated combat and engaged the creature immediately. Over the course of five intense rounds, Norn repeatedly struck the mimic with their longsword, steadily chipping away at its 58 HP, while deftly avoiding many of the mimic's pseudopod and acid attacks. Though initially evasive, the mimic eventually landed a couple of damaging blows, reducing Norn's HP from 25 to 12. In the final exchange, Norn landed a critical hit followed by a solid strike, delivering a fatal 21 points of damage that brought the mimic down to zero and ended the threat. The mimic's defeated, gooey corpse remained on the floor of the Great Hall. For this victory, Norn was awarded 450 experience points."

The battle began with the ghostly knight attacking, but Norn's wards and armor thwarted each deadly strike. Seizing the opportunity, Norn unleashed a devastating counterattack, scoring multiple critical hits and inflicting heavy damage. Despite the shadow's relentless assaults, including a chilling touch that dealt cold damage to Norn, the fighter's resilience and precise strikes wore down the foe. In the second round, Norn's focused attacks culminated in the Shadow's dissolution, ending the spectral threat and restoring a fragile calm to the arcane-laden chamber. With the Shadow of Sir Garran defeated, Norn earned 2900 experience points for the victory.\",\n  \"combat_round\": 2,\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateEncounter\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"encounterId\": \"LordStudyCombat\",\n        \"changes\": \"Shadow of Sir Garran takes 72 damage, HP reduced from 90 to 18 after first round; further 19 damage in second round reduces HP from 18 to 0, Shadow defeated and dissipated.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"characterName\": \"Norn\",\n        \"changes\": \"HP reduced from 18 to 13 due to 5 cold damage from Shadow's chilling touch; healed earlier with Second Wind to 18 HP; status alive, condition none.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"exit\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
