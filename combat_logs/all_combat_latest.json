Three successes mean you stabilize and stop making death saves, remaining unconscious but no longer dying. Three failures result in death. Any natural 20 on a death saving throw allows you to regain 1 hit point and regain consciousness immediately. If you take any damage while unconscious, you automatically fail a death saving throw, or take two failures if the damage is a critical hit. You can be stabilized by receiving healing from an ally, but until then, you must rely on these death saves. Your next turn, you will make the first death saving throw.
