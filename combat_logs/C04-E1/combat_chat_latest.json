However, the player input was asking about the resolution of their initial surprise attack, which should be resolved before regular initiative begins. Furthermore, the narration does not address the player's question about whether their initial arrow hit, and instead processes enemy turns as if the player's action never occurred. Additionally, the combat_round remains at 1, which is correct, but the turn order and player action resolution are not handled properly.\n\nFirst, resolve Norn's initial surprise attack (as the player asked if it hit). Narrate the result, apply any damage to the Skeletal Archer, and update its HP accordingly. If the Skeletal Archer is reduced to 0 HP, it should be marked dead and not act in the initiative order.
