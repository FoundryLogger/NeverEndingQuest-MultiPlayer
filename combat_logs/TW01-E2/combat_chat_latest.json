One wolf is badly hurt, another is unscathed and looming dangerously, and the third circles with silent, predatory patience.\\n\\nYou steel yourself, shield raised, knowing every move counts. Eirik, you can take a single decisive action this round—swing your mace, fire your crossbow, or cast a spell as your main action. Some spells like Healing Word can be cast as a bonus action if you wish to heal while also acting. You can move as you see fit. But you can't attack with your weapon and cast a normal spell in the same turn unless one of them is a bonus action.\\n\\nYour shield arm aches from the wolf's corrupting bite, but you still stand firm. Kira, bleeding and desperate, gives you a nod: 'Your move, Eirik. Make it count.'\\n\\nTop of initiative recap: Corrupted Wolf_2 (10/18 HP, just hit hard), Corrupted Wolf (18/18 HP, dangerous), Scout Kira (3/10 HP, badly wounded), Eirik (7/11 HP), Corrupted Wolf_3 (18/18 HP, still to act this round). The wolves are pressing in—one is within melee of both you and Kira.\\n\\nYour hand tightens on your mace, your holy symbol cold at your neck. The enemy is vulnerable, but so are your allies.

The battle erupts with the wolves striking first, inflicting grievous wounds on both Kira and Eirik. Kira manages a precise arrow shot, wounding one wolf, but the wolves' relentless assault soon renders Eirik unconscious. Throughout several brutal rounds, Eirik clings desperately to life, repeatedly succeeding on death saving throws, while Kira falls unconscious and requires stabilization. In a last desperate act, Eirik throws alchemist's fire, igniting one wolf and temporarily slowing its fury. Despite grievous injuries, Eirik protects Kira with his final strength, and against all odds, their combined resilience causes the last wolf to hesitate and ultimately retreat into the forest. The clearing falls silent, bathed in the fading embers of alchemists' fire and the heavy breaths of two battered survivors. The encounter ends with two corrupted wolves defeated and the survival of Eirik and Kira uncertain but hopeful.\",\n  \"combat_round\": 7,\n  \"actions\": [\n    \"Round 1: Corrupted Wolf_2 bites Scout Kira twice, wounding her severely.
