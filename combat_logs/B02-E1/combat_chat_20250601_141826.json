    "content": "Your previous response had issues with the combat logic: The narration incorrectly states that the giant spider has 4 HP left after taking 7 damage, when it actually should be at -3 HP and dead. The narration also does not declare the spider dead or defeated, nor does it end the encounter. The action array correctly updates the HP and status, but the narration does not match the mechanical outcome.\n\nAfter Norn deals 7 damage to the giant spider (4 - 7 = -3 HP), the narration must state that the giant spider is killed/defeated and can no longer act. The encounter should end if there are no other living enemies. Include an 'exit' action to close the encounter. Example: 'Your blade slices through the giant spider, and with a final shriek, it collapses to the ground, dead. The outpost falls quiet as the last threat is vanquished.'.
