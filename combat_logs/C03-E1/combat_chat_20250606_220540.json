The player already rolled to hit previously (a 19), which would hit the Shadow's AC. The damage should be applied to the Shadow, reducing its HP from 6 to 0, and the Shadow should be marked as dead/defeated. The narration failed to process the Shadow's defeat and did not update HP or status fields.\n\nAfter the player rolls a 19 to hit (which hits), and then rolls 9 damage, the Shadow's HP should be reduced from 6 to 0. The response should include an 'updateEncounter' action to set the Shadow's HP to 0 and status to 'dead' (or 'defeated'), and narrate the Shadow's destruction. Since all enemies are defeated, include the 'exit' action to end combat. Example actions:\n\n- updateEncounter: Shadow HP 0, status 'dead', condition 'none', condition_affected []\n- narration: The Shadow is struck by Norn's sword, dissipates into wisps of darkness, and is defeated.\n- exit: End of encounter..
