The rest of the narration and HP tracking is correct, and the action is properly formatted. Initiative order and round tracking are correct. However, the error in dice usage is a major rules violation.\n\nThe combat narration should use the first available d4 preroll (which is 4), add the rat's +2 damage bonus for a total of 6 damage. The narration should state: 'Rolling damage with the prerolled d4 of 4, plus 2 piercing damage, the total is 6.' The HP update is correct (19 - 6 = 13). Do not reference impossible dice results.
