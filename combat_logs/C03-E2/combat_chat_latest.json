    "content": "Your previous response had issues with the combat logic: There is a major issue with HP tracking and death detection. The narration correctly applies 10 damage to the first giant rat, reducing its HP from 7 to -3, and marks it as dead. However, the narration then allows the first giant rat (now dead) to take its turn and attack Norn, which is a violation of the death detection rule. Dead creatures cannot act after being reduced to 0 HP or below. Only living creatures should take actions in initiative order. Additionally, the HP math for Norn is inconsistent: Norn was at 23 HP, but the narration says 'reducing HP from 31 to 23,' which does not match the current HP state (Norn was already at 23 HP before taking any damage this round).\n\nAfter Norn's attack, the first giant rat should be immediately marked as dead and removed from the initiative order for this round. Only Giant Rat_2 and Giant Rat_3 should take their turns. Giant Rat_2 attacks and misses. Giant Rat_3 attacks and hits, dealing 5 piercing damage to Norn (HP goes from 23 to 18). The narration should not include any action for the first giant rat after it is killed. The actions array should only update the dead rat and Norn's new HP. Combat_round should remain 1..
