The encounter began with Norn striking twice at the ghoul, inflicting substantial wounds, and eventually slaying it with a decisive final blow. The gibbering mouther, a grotesque mass of eyes and mouths, relentlessly attacked with ferocious bites but failed to penetrate Norn's defenses. Through successive rounds, Norn unleashed precision longsword strikes, dealing critical and continuous damage, gradually reducing the mouther's vitality. Despite its frenzied multiattack attempts, the gibbering mouther could not overcome Norn's skillful evasion and steady assaults. Finally, two well-placed attacks ended the mouther’s maddened gibbering, collapsing it into a lifeless heap on the cold stone floor. The ghoul's corpse and the gibbering mouther's remains were left behind, marking the end of the deadly confrontation. For overcoming these perils, Norn was awarded a total of 650 experience points, reflecting the defeat of a CR 1 ghoul worth 200 XP and a CR 2 gibbering mouther worth 450 XP.\",\n  \"combat_round\": 6,\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"characterName\": \"Norn\",\n        \"changes\": \"Alive with 39 HP and no conditions.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateEncounter\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"encounterId\": \"XXX\",\n        \"changes\": \"Ghoul defeated and at 0 HP, gibbering mouther defeated and at 0 HP.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"exit\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
