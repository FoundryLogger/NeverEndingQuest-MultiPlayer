# Player Storage System - Complete Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a fully agentic player storage system that allows players to create and manage storage containers at specific locations using natural language descriptions.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Player-Initiated Storage
- Storage devices only become functional when players explicitly decide to use them
- No automatic conversion of location items into containers
- Player agency drives all storage creation and management

### Central Repository Architecture
- Single `player_storage.json` file tracks all player-created storage
- Separate from module files but tied to specific locations
- Persistent across sessions and module transitions

### Fully Agentic Processing
- Natural language descriptions processed by secondary AI (full model)
- Similar to updateCharacterInfo workflow
- AI converts descriptions to validated JSON operations

### 3. AI Integration

#### System Prompt Updates
```
STORAGE SYSTEM:
Players can create storage containers at locations to organize their inventory.
When a player mentions storing items or using containers, recognize this as storage intent.
Pass natural language descriptions to the storage processor for validation.

Examples:
- "I store my extra gold in a chest in the gaol"
- "I put the ancient artifacts in a lockbox here"  
- "I retrieve my arrows from the storage we created"
- "What's in our chest at the tavern?"
```

#### Storage Processor AI Prompt
```
You are a storage operations specialist for a 5e RPG system. Convert natural language storage descriptions into valid JSON operations.

CONTEXT:
- Character data: {character_info}
- Current location: {location_info}
- Existing storage: {storage_info}

TASK: Convert this description into a valid storage operation:
"{storage_description}"

OUTPUT: Valid JSON matching the storage action schema.
```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Create Storage and Store Items
1. **Player**: "I store my extra gold in a chest in the gaol"
2. **Main AI**: Recognizes storage intent, calls storage processor
3. **Storage Processor**: 
   ```json
   {
     "action": "create_storage",
     "character": "Norn",
     "storage_type": "chest",
     "storage_name": "Gaol Storage Chest",
     "location_description": "gaol",
     "item_name": "Gold Coins", 
     "quantity": 500
   }
   ```
4. **Storage Manager**: 
   - Creates backup of character file
   - Creates backup of storage file
   - Validates operation
   - Creates storage entry
   - Transfers gold from character to storage
   - Updates both files atomically

### Example 2: Retrieve Items
1. **Player**: "I get my arrows from the chest we made here"
2. **Storage Processor**:
   ```json
   {
     "action": "retrieve_item",
     "character": "Norn", 
     "storage_id": "storage_001",
     "item_name": "Ancient Arrows",
     "quantity": 10
   }
   ```
3. **Storage Manager**: Transfers arrows from storage to character inventory

### Example 3: View Storage
1. **Player**: "What's in our storage here?"
2. **Location Manager**: Displays available storage automatically
3. **Output**: "A chest here contains: Gold Coins (500), Ancient Arrows (20)"

## Safety & Data Protection

### Atomic File Operations
```python
def atomic_file_update(file_path, new_data):
    backup_path = f"{file_path}.backup_{timestamp}"
    
    try:
        # Create backup
        shutil.copy2(file_path, backup_path)
        
        # Validate new data
        validate_schema(new_data)
        
        # Write new data
        safe_json_dump(new_data, file_path)
        
        # Remove backup on success
        os.remove(backup_path)
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Restore backup on failure
        if os.path.exists(backup_path):
            shutil.copy2(backup_path, file_path)
            os.remove(backup_path)
        raise e
```

### Character Inventory Protection
- Validate item exists before removal
- Verify quantities are sufficient
- Create character file backup before any modification
- Rollback character changes if storage operation fails

### Error Handling
- Schema validation for all operations
- Graceful handling of invalid requests
- Clear error messages for players
- Full operation rollback on any failure
