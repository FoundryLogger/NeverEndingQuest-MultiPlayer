To gain entry, they must solve an ancient dwarven puzzle lock. The puzzle consists of a circular stone door with five concentric rings, each engraved with dwarven runes. The party must rotate these rings to align specific runes, creating a code based on clues found throughout their journey. Once the correct sequence is set, they will be confronted by a stone guradian and must speak the dwarven phrase 'Khazad-d\u00c3\u00bbm' to to deactivate the stone guardian and open the door.",
