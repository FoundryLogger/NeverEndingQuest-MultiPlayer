The morning promise of Harrow's Hollow is warm with hope, but as you prepare yourself for the journey to the outlying homesteads, an unnatural hesitation settles over the world--a sense that the very air resists your next step.\n\nYou glance back at the notice board. The directions are clear, the markers bright, yet as you attempt to move toward the East Gate and Guardhouse, the world itself seems to freeze in place--a silent warning that the path forward cannot be opened at this time.\n\nA pair of guards at the edge of the square exchange uncertain looks. One calls out gently, \"Seems there's a trouble with the road east, friend Norn. Perhaps best to wait, or see if Elder Mirna's got further word?\"\n\nYour progress is halted by a force greater than any curse--a missing piece in the tapestry of the Hollow's world. Until the road to the outlying homesteads is restored, you remain in the heart of the village, your quest log and map burning with the promise of journeys not yet begun. For now, all you can do is wait, explore other nearby locations, or seek out Elder Mirna or the villagers for news and comfort while the Hollow's destiny hangs in the balance.",
      "ai_action": "ISSUE REPORT:\n\n- ISSUE TYPE: PROGRESSION_BLOCKED\n- DESCRIPTION: Despite clear quest directions and markers to proceed to the East Gate and beyond, an invisible obstacle or world freeze prevents the player from moving forward. NPC guards acknowledge the issue and suggest waiting or consulting Elder Mirna. This indicates a missing or incomplete world state or event blocking progress.\n- IMPACT: Player is softlocked in the village center, unable to advance to key quest locations or objectives.\n- REPRODUCTION STEPS:\n  1. Accept quest and review directions to East Gate and homesteads.\n  2. Attempt to travel eastward.\n  3. Encounter invisible barrier or world freeze preventing movement.\n  4. NPC guards comment on the road trouble and suggest waiting.\n\n- RECOMMENDATION: Investigate world state triggers, event flags, or missing data causing the path freeze. Ensure all prerequisite conditions for opening the road are met or properly scripted. Provide player feedback or alternative options to avoid frustration.\n\nUntil fixed, the main quest progression is halted at this critical juncture. Further testing or workarounds are not possible. Awaiting resolution instructions.",

Old Marna, noticing your furrowed brow, offers a gentle smile. \"Sometimes, even heroes must wait for the world to catch up, Norn. If you need anything while you're here--supplies, news, or company--just ask. When the roads open, you'll be ready.\"\n\nFor now, your only options are to rest, gather information, or explore the still-accessible locations in Harrow's Hollow.

No one's seen anything like it since before the curse was lifted, and even then the roads were only shadowed, never closed.\"\n\nShe glances out the window, frowning thoughtfully. \"Last night, there was a chill draft through the shop, and my shutters rattled, but I saw nothing outside. Some folks reckon it's the curse lingering, or maybe a spirit unsettled by recent events. But others believe it's just the Hollow reminding us that some things need proper tending--rituals, words, or a helping hand.\"\n\nMarna's voice softens. \"If you want my advice, try another route. Sometimes, the Hollow opens a door when you least expect it. The East Gate and Guardhouse, the Militia Barracks, and the Wyrd Lantern Inn are all open. Speak to folks there. If something unnatural is at work, stirring up the village might just shake the path free--or at least you'll gather clues. If you find anything amiss, come back and I'll help however I can.\"\n\nHer gaze holds yours, full of steady trust. \"The Hollow has always responded to care and courage. Keep faith, Norn.\"\n\nWith your options clear, you can choose to venture to the East Gate and Guardhouse, Militia Barracks, or the Wyrd Lantern Inn to seek answers, rouse the villagers, or look for a way to clear the path to the Town Square.
