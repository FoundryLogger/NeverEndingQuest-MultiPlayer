      "game_output": "The warm, slightly dusty air of the Harrow's Hollow General Store surrounds you, its shelves stacked with all manner of goods: coils of rope, bundled herbs, lanterns both battered and new, and the distinct smell of wax mingling with leather. The faint clang of the brass bell above the front door still echoes in your ears.\n\nBehind the thick counter stands Elder Mirna Harrow, the formidable matriarch of the village. Her silver-threaded hair is pulled back in a practical knot, and her eyes--sharp as a hawk's--study you with a mixture of hope and caution. She traces her finger absently across the pages of a battered ledger, but you can tell her focus is squarely on you.\n\n\"Back so soon, Norn?\" she says, her voice low so as not to carry beyond the counter. \"There's always another shadow on the horizon these days. If you need supplies before heading out again, just say the word. Or, if you're here for news... well, these are troubled times for talk.\"\n\nNearby, a cluttered notice board draws your eye with its scrawled postings: a missing pet, rumors of livestock theft, a reward for any news of Scout Elen--her name circled in dark ink. Among the goods on a low shelf sits an old bronze key, tarnished and heavy, marked with a faded raven sigil.\n\nElder Mirna watches you closely, her fingers drumming a slow rhythm on the wood. She seems guarded, her gaze flickering briefly toward the key. If you wish to know more about it--or about the troubled history of the keep--you sense you'll need to press her, perhaps with a careful word or a discerning eye.\n\nWhat would you like to do? Do you browse the wares, question Elder Mirna about the key, inspect the notices, or try to glean truths hidden behind her practiced reserve?",

She gives a small, practiced smile, but you sense a flicker of discomfort behind it.\n\n\"Ah, that old thing? Just a trinket, really. Been in the store for years. Folk say it belonged to one of the old families, but nobody's claimed it in a generation. Some think it opens a cellar or a lockbox lost to time. I reckon it's just another relic of the Hollow's past.\"\n\nYet her gaze lingers on you, and there's a subtle tension in her posture--a hesitation, as if she's holding something back.\n\nIf you want to discern whether Elder Mirna is telling you the whole truth about the key, please make an Insight check.

The raven sigil belonged to House Greymont, the old lords of the keep before... well, before darkness claimed it. My family has watched over the Hollow for generations. When the Greymonts fell, the survivors left relics--keys to places best left undisturbed.\"\n\nShe glances around to ensure no others are listening and continues, \"Some say the key opens a path into the keep itself, or perhaps a vault beneath it. I never had the courage to try, nor would I send someone unprepared. But you, after all you've done for us... perhaps you're meant to have it.\"\n\nMirna hesitates, eyes searching your face for resolve. \"If you truly mean to press on against the curse, then take the key, with my blessing and my warning: House Greymont's secrets are like old wounds--disturbed, they bleed anew.\"\n\nShe slides the cold bronze key across the counter toward you, its weight more than just metal in your palm.\n\n\"May you find answers where my courage failed,\" she finishes quietly. \"And may the Hollow never have cause to regret it.\"\n\nYou have gained the 'Old bronze key marked with a faded raven sigil'.",
