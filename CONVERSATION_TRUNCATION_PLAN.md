# Conversation History Truncation System - Detailed Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Objective**: Create an intelligent conversation history truncation system that compresses the current 45K token conversation history down to ~24K tokens while preserving all critical game data through AI-powered location transition summarization.

**Problem Statement**: The conversation_history.json file has grown to 45K tokens, causing performance issues and approaching AI context limits. We need intelligent compression that maintains game continuity without losing important information.

## 📋 Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Token Counting Infrastructure

#### File: `conversation_analyzer.py`
**Purpose**: Analyze current conversation structure and calculate compression requirements

**Key Classes & Methods**:
```python
class ConversationAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, conversation_file_path):
        # Load conversation history from JSON
        # Initialize token estimation parameters
    
    def estimate_tokens(self, text):
        # Estimate tokens using word count approximation (1 token ≈ 0.75 words)
        # Handle JSON formatting overhead
        # Return accurate token count estimates
    
    def find_location_transitions(self, conversation):
        # Scan conversation for location change indicators
        # Identify "currentLocation" and "currentLocationId" changes
        # Map conversation segments by location
        # Return list of transition points with message indices
    
    def calculate_compression_needed(self, current_tokens, target_tokens):
        # Calculate required compression ratio (45K → 24K = 47% reduction)
        # Determine number of location transitions to merge
        # Account for summary overhead in calculations
    
    def identify_compression_segments(self, transitions):
        # Group consecutive location transitions for summarization
        # Preserve recent activity (last 5-10 transitions)
        # Target older segments for compression
        # Return segment groups with start/end boundaries
    
    def generate_analysis_report(self):
        # Current token count breakdown
        # Location transition frequency
        # Compression targets and ratios
        # Expected output size estimation
```

**Integration Points**:
- Reads from `conversation_history.json`
- Outputs analysis to `conversation_analysis.json`
- Used by subsequent compression phases

#### File: `token_estimator.py`
**Purpose**: Accurate token counting utilities

**Key Functions**:

    # Handle special characters and formatting
    
def estimate_tokens_from_json(json_data):
    # JSON structure overhead calculation
    # Message-by-message token counting
