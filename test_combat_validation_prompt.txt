  "narration": "The Shadow attempts to drain your strength! Using preroll d20 of 12 + 4 = 16 vs your AC 19, it misses. The skeletal warrior rises again and attacks with its rusty blade! Rolling d20... 18 + 4 = 22, that hits! You take 5 slashing damage. Now it's your turn Norn. The Shadow is wounded but still dangerous, and the skeleton continues its assault. What would you like to do?",
