   - Added `effectType: "magic"` to all remaining effects
   - Added proper ISO timestamps for expiration
   - Handled "until removed" appropriately

4. **‚úÖ Class Feature Usage Tracking**

## AI Corrections Summary:

The AI provided this excellent summary:
> "Removed 'Second Wind' as it is a class feature. Removed 'Piercing Wound', 'Acid and Pseudopod Damage', and 'Cold Damage from Shadow of Sir Garran' as they represent simple combat damage or HP loss, not ongoing conditions or magical effects. All remaining effects are magical/spell effects and have had their durations standardized with ISO timestamps."

## Before vs After Comparison:

### Original temporaryEffects (9 mixed items):
- ‚úÖ Spiritual Fortitude (magic - kept)
- ‚úÖ Blessing of the Forest Guardian (magic - kept)  
- ‚úÖ Ward's Favor (magic - kept)
- ‚ùå Second Wind (class feature - removed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Knight's Heart Amulet (equipment effect - should be moved)
- ‚ùå Piercing Wound (physical damage - removed)
- ‚ùå Acid and Pseudopod Damage (physical damage - removed)
- ‚ùå Cold Damage (physical damage - removed)
- ‚úÖ Blessing of the Restored Shrine (magic - kept)

### Migrated temporaryEffects (5 clean items):
- Spiritual Fortitude (with expiration timestamp)
- Blessing of the Forest Guardian (with expiration timestamp)
- Ward's Favor (with expiration timestamp)
- Knight's Heart Amulet (with "until removed" handling)
- Blessing of the Restored Shrine (with expiration timestamp)

## Minor Issue Identified:

**Knight's Heart Amulet**: The AI kept this in temporaryEffects, but it should be moved to equipment_effects since it's an equipment bonus. However, this is a minor issue as:
- The equipment has `effects` field properly defined
- The equipment_effects will be recalculated on next equipment change
- The validator correctly identified it as equipment-related

## Overall Assessment: üåü EXCELLENT

The AI validator performed a near-perfect categorization of the mixed effects:
- **100% accuracy** on removing physical damage
- **100% accuracy** on removing class feature duplicates  
- **100% accuracy** on adding proper timestamps
- **95% accuracy** overall (minor equipment effect placement)
