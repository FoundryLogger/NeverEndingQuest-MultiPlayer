I'd like to solve the puzzle. I rotate the rings to align the runes based on the clues we've found during our journey.

## Dungeon Master Response

You carefully examine the dwarven runes engraved on the circular stone door. The five concentric rings each bear a series of runes, some glowing faintly. You recognize similarities between these runes and the words you've encountered in the Forgotten Library and the journal from the corpse. The runes seem to correspond to dwarven phrases related to the Elemental Forge.

You place your hands on the outermost ring of the ancient stone door, feeling the cool, worn surface beneath your fingers. Drawing upon the clues you've gathered—the partial phrases from the Forgotten Library, the journal held by the fallen Enclave member, and the glowing dwarven runes—you begin to carefully rotate the rings.

The circular stone door slowly grinds open as you and your companions complete the ancient dwarven rune puzzle. As the last ring clicks into place, the air trembles and the stone figure of a larger-than-life dwarven soldier carved in the wall shifts and steps forward — the Stone Guardian has awakened. Its cold, unblinking eyes fixate on your party. The guardian's heavy footsteps echo loudly on the stone floor as it towers over you, its massive arms ready to slam down with crushing force.
