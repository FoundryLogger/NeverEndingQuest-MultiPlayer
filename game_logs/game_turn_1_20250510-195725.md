## Dungeon Master Response

You carefully inspect the dwarven runes etched into the five concentric rings of the stone door. As you trace the patterns with your eyes, you notice that some runes are etched more deeply and appear more worn, suggesting their prominence in the sequence. Your mind recalls fragments from the journal and the phrases from the Forgotten Library — the three possible dwarven words that might relate to the artifact and the forge.

Norn, you focus intently on the glowing dwarven runes etched into the five concentric rings of the stone door. The faint pulsations of the runes seem almost rhythmic, suggesting a hidden pattern. As your fingers hover near the rings, you notice that certain runes correspond to symbols you’ve seen before — from the Forgotten Library's ancient texts and the partial solutions scribbled in the worn journal found near the corpse.
