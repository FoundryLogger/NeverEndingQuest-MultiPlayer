## Dungeon Master Response

You carefully rotate the five concentric rings of the ancient dwarven door, aligning the runes based on the clues you've pieced together from the journal, the Forgotten Library, and your previous encounters. As the final ring clicks into place, a deep rumbling resonates through the stone, and the faint glow of the runes intensifies.

The battle for entry into the ancient dwarven complex has begun as the towering Stone Guardian comes to life, its stony form moving with surprising agility for such a massive construct. It bellows a deep, rumbling challenge, demanding the password to pass. The air crackles with tension. The initiative order is clear: The Stone Guardian and Elara act first, then Gilly, followed by Norn and Thalor.

You steel yourself and step forward, ready to engage the Stone Guardian looming before you. The air is thick with anticipation as the guardian's eyes glow ominously. Now is the moment for your attack. Please roll a d20 and add your attack bonus of +5 for your longsword or any other weapon you'd prefer to use. Let me know the total, and we'll see if your strike finds its mark.
