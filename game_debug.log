- Main quest lead: Seek out Elder Mirna in the Town Square for official village restoration tasks.
- Alternative option: Help Marna restock the storeroom by fetching a crate from the inn's cellar as a simple task.
- Additional context: Village is recovering from a curse, rebuilding efforts underway, trust and goodwill important.
- No immediate quest objectives given, but clear direction to find Elder Mirna for main quest tasks.
- Quest objectives appear clear: find Elder Mirna for official quest assignment.
- No quest markers or tracking mentioned yet.

Next step: I will proceed directly to the Town Square to find Elder Mirna as per highest priority for main quest discovery.

Action: Leave the general store and move directly to the Town Square to locate Elder Mirna.  
I will ask Elder Mirna explicitly for any quests or tasks upon meeting her, using keywords: "quest", "help", "task", "mission", "problem".  
I will document quest details and verify quest tracking after receipt.

Action:  
- First, survey the gate area carefully for any signs of ambush, traps, or suspicious activity.  
- Then, engage in conversation with the local watch NPC(s) to gather any additional information or instructions related to the caravan protection quest.  
- Finally, check and prepare gear to ensure readiness for any potential combat or challenges.

Please proceed with the survey and inform me of any findings or NPCs present.

- ISSUE TYPE: PROGRESSION_BLOCKED
- DESCRIPTION: Attempted to survey the East Gate area for threats, but loading the area data failed with error "Failed to load new area data from campaigns/Keep_of_Doom/A03.json".
- IMPACT: Unable to proceed with scouting or interacting with local watch NPC at East Gate. This blocks main quest progression and testing of quest-related NPC dialogue and environmental cues.
- REPRO STEPS: Upon arrival at East Gate and issuing survey action, game attempted to load area data file A03.json and failed.
- EXPECTED: Area data should load successfully, allowing player to survey, interact with NPCs, and prepare for caravan arrival.
- ADDITIONAL NOTES: This error constitutes a critical progression blocker as the main quest requires presence at East Gate.

RECOMMENDATION: Investigate missing or corrupted area data file campaigns/Keep_of_Doom/A03.json and restore it to enable quest continuation. Implement error handling to prevent softlock.

Please advise on next steps or provide workaround to continue main quest testing.

- ISSUE TYPE: PROGRESSION_BLOCKED (Escalated)
- DESCRIPTION: Following previous area load failure, an additional error "Failed to handle location transition" occurred upon attempting to move to the East Gate area.
- IMPACT: Location transition failure compounds the progression block, preventing access to critical main quest location and halting quest progression testing.
- REPRO STEPS: After initial load failure of campaigns/Keep_of_Doom/A03.json, any attempt to transition or move to East Gate triggers this error.
- EXPECTED: Smooth location transition with area data loading and environment rendering.
- ADDITIONAL NOTES: This error indicates potential deeper issues with area data management or transition mechanics.

RECOMMENDATION: Prioritize fixing area data loading and location transition systems to unblock main quest progression. Implement fallback or error recovery to avoid player softlock.

Requesting guidance or patch to bypass this error for continued testing of main quest.

Action:
1. Speak to Elder Mirna again to request explicit directions or guidance on the route to the East Gate.
   - Use clear keywords: "East Gate", "path", "route", "directions".
   - Confirm if any intermediate areas or steps are required to reach the East Gate.
2. If Elder Mirna cannot assist, then ask a nearby guard for guidance.
3. Avoid backtracking unnecessarily until clear route is confirmed.

This approach aligns with testing for quest clarity, navigation guidance, and prevention of player confusion or softlock.

Please provide dialogue or information from Elder Mirna regarding directions to the East Gate.

2025-05-25 15:30:57 - INFO - AI: ISSUE REPORT:

- ISSUE TYPE: PROGRESSION_BLOCKED
- DESCRIPTION: Main quest progression blocked due to inaccessible East Gate caused by missing or corrupted path/area data.
- IMPACT: Player cannot proceed to assigned main quest location or complete critical quest objectives.
- IN-CHARACTER RESPONSE: Elder Mirna and militia acknowledge the problem and suggest waiting or assisting locally.
- ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS: Player offered side tasks or downtime in the square, but these are outside main quest critical path.

TESTING NOTES:
- The game currently lacks a workaround or alternate route to reach the East Gate.
- No in-game prompt or quest update indicating the blockage or alternative objectives.
- Quest tracking still shows primary objective as "Guard the supply caravan at East Gate," causing potential confusion.
- Suggest implementing quest fail-safe or notification for players when critical path is blocked.

NEXT STEPS:
- In-character, I will report the issue to Elder Mirna explicitly for official acknowledgment and possible quest adjustment.
- Request if there is an alternate mission or temporary task to maintain main quest progression.
- If no alternate main quest tasks are available, I will briefly explore the General Store for any side quests or preparation until the issue is resolved.

Action:
"Elder Mirna, the path to the East Gate appears blocked or inaccessible. Is there an alternative way to proceed with the quest, or a temporary task I can undertake to aid the village while this is resolved?"

Please provide Elder Mirna's response or next available quest options.

2025-05-25 15:31:08 - INFO - AI: ISSUE SUMMARY:

- Main quest progression is currently blocked due to inaccessible East Gate.
- Elder Mirna acknowledges the issue in-story and suggests engaging in side activities until the main path reopens.
- No alternate main quest or priority quest is given to bypass the blockage.
- This effectively stalls main quest critical path progression.
- Quest tracking remains on the original main quest without update or fail-safe.

TESTING DECISION:

To continue thorough testing and document side content availability and NPC interactions during main quest downtime, I will proceed with a side activity.

Action:  
I will speak with Old Tommen first to test NPC interaction, side quest or lore dialogue, and to verify that side content is accessible and functional while the main quest is blocked.

Please provide the dialogue or options available when interacting with Old Tommen.

Action plan for testing:

1. Transition back into the General Store from the Town Square as per instructions.
2. Once inside the General Store, look for the side door or back lane that leads east toward the palisade and East Gate.
3. Attempt to move through the side door to access the palisade area.
4. If blocked or requiring a key, interact with Old Marna in the store to request assistance or the key.
5. Verify that the path from General Store to East Gate loads correctly, to resolve prior area loading errors.
6. Confirm quest tracking updates and markers correctly guide to the East Gate after this transition.
7. Report any loading errors, pathfinding issues, or NPC interaction problems during this sequence.

I will now proceed to exit the Town Square into the General Store, then seek the side passage eastward. Please update me on the environment and any relevant NPC interactions.

2025-05-25 15:32:27 - INFO - AI: ISSUE REPORT SUMMARY:

- Main quest to guard the caravan at East Gate remains blocked due to inaccessible route.
- Elder Mirna offers alternative side quests to maintain player engagement.
- Options given:
  1. Aid Old Marna at the General Store (restocking supplies and dealing with rats)
  2. Help merchant by the statue (loading goods)
  3. Investigate Old Tommen's claims of restless shades on the moors
- Elder Mirna offers to mark these side tasks in quest log.
- No updates or workarounds provided to unblock main quest critical path.
- Side quests provided to avoid player downtime, but do not advance main storyline.

TESTING DECISION:

To continue testing side quest implementation and quest log updates, I will opt to aid Old Marna at the General Store.

Action:
- Accept the side quest to help Old Marna.
- Verify that the quest is added to the quest log with clear objectives.
- Proceed to the General Store to interact with Old Marna and begin the task.
- Monitor quest tracking, NPC dialogue, and environment loading.
- Report any issues or inconsistencies.

Requesting quest log update and side quest details for aiding Old Marna before proceeding.

2025-05-25 15:32:37 - INFO - AI: Summary of side quest lead:

- Old Tommen reports a restless shade near the old stone marker on the moors, seen recently.
- Shade is mysterious, speaks in riddles, potentially dangerous.
- Suggested tasks:
  1. Investigate the shade on the moor at night.
  2. Search beneath the knight's statue for a trinket linked to luck or curses.
- Both options appear to be side quests offering lore, exploration, and possible quest progression.
- Tommen's dialogue provides atmospheric and quest flavor.

Testing decision:

To comprehensively test side content and quest variety, I will first choose to search beneath the knight's statue for the trinket.

Action plan:

1. Move to the statue in the Town Square.
2. Search carefully beneath the statue's base for the trinket.
3. Document any interactive elements, loot, or quest triggers found.
4. Verify if this action updates quest log or provides new objectives.
5. Report any issues with interaction, missing objects, or quest tracking.

Please provide details of the statue area and any items or interactions available.

2025-05-25 15:34:50 - INFO - AI: ISSUE REPORT:

- ISSUE TYPE: PROGRESSION_BLOCKED / INPUT HANDLING FAILURE
- DESCRIPTION: In main_game_loop at line 544, the game attempts to read user input with the `input()` function but this may cause blocking or failure in automated test environment.
- IMPACT: User input prompt may hang or disrupt automated testing, halting progression.
- REPRO STEPS: During main quest testing invoking main_game_loop.
- EXPECTED: Input handling should be compatible with both manual and automated testing modes, allowing smooth progression.
- ADDITIONAL NOTES: Input blocking may interfere with automated speedrun testing.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Implement non-blocking or simulated input methods for automated testing.
- Add timeout or default input handling to prevent stalls.
- Separate input/output handling from game logic to improve testability.

This issue contributes to testing interruptions and should be addressed alongside prior threading and encoding fixes.

2025-05-25 15:34:56 - INFO - AI: ISSUE REPORT:

- ISSUE TYPE: LOGGING FAILURE DURING MOCK INPUT HANDLING
- DESCRIPTION: During automated testing, the mock_input function at line 55 attempts to log AI responses using game_logger.info but may cause logging errors or crashes.
- IMPACT: Logging failure interrupts automated input simulation, halting test execution.
- REPRO STEPS: Triggered during automated test input cycles.
- EXPECTED: Logging should handle all input strings, including special characters, without error.
- ADDITIONAL NOTES: This may be related to previous encoding issues affecting logging subsystem.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Ensure logging system supports Unicode and special characters.
- Add error handling around logging calls to prevent test interruption.
- Review and sanitize AI response strings before logging.

Resolving this alongside prior encoding and threading issues is essential for stable automated quest testing.

2025-05-25 15:35:02 - INFO - AI: ISSUE REPORT:

- ISSUE TYPE: LOGGING SUBSYSTEM FAILURE
- DESCRIPTION: In enhanced_logger.py line 133, the info() method calls self.logger.handle(record), which may be failing or causing exceptions during logging operations.
- IMPACT: Failure in logging handler disrupts game logging, possibly halting automated tests and obscuring diagnostic information.
- REPRO STEPS: Occurs during logging of AI responses or other game events.
- EXPECTED: Logging handlers should process records without error.
- ADDITIONAL NOTES: This issue likely ties into previous encoding and logging errors, impacting test stability.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Review logging handler implementation for robustness.
- Add exception handling within logging to prevent propagation.
- Test logging with diverse input to ensure stability.

Fixing this is crucial to maintain reliable logs for debugging and testing main quest progression.
