"She set out to check the old east trail at dawn three mornings ago, after reports of strange lights and a lingering fog near the forest edge. She left from the square, carrying her bow and that old signal horn she prized. Several folk saw her pass the general store on her way out."

I proceed directly to the East Gate and Guardhouse and conduct a thorough examination of the structure and surroundings, then engage in conversation with any guards or attendants present to inquire about recent activity or unusual events.
