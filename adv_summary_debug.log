Ancient standing stones lean close as if whispering secrets, softly illuminated by flickering blue witchlights from above. Evidence of Scout Elen's hurried passage is plainly visible: a bootprint pressed deep in the mud, a broken branch snapped at waist height, and a scrap of faded blue cloth caught in a thorn bush, all pointing northward into the Gloamwood. Several carefully placed items suggest a mixture of ritual offerings and signs of panic-- a silver pendant etched with protective runes hangs deliberately from a standing stone, a weathered leather pouch containing silver coins rests in an alcove, and near a cairn lies a broken lantern stained with soot alongside a small silver coin gleaming faintly beneath it. Additionally, a half-burned map showing part of the forest trail with singed edges was found, hinting at a frantic escape. The ancient ward markers faintly pulse with protective magic, their glow now mingling with the subtle pulse of the ritual items. The trail northward toward the Withered Shrine beckons through the deepening shadows, while the path back to Harrow's Hollow East Gate remains a short five-minute walk through the shadowed woods.", "dmInstructions": "This location serves as the transition from Harrow's Hollow to the Gloamwood.

The ancient ward markers continue to pulse with faint protective magic, now mingled with the energy of these tokens. No immediate threats are present.

They observed clear signs of Scout Elen's hurried passage: a bootprint pressed in the mud, a snapped branch, and a scrap of faded blue cloth caught in a thorn bush, all evidence of her flight northward into the Gloamwood. Upon investigation, the party discovered several carefully placed items indicating both ritual offerings and signs of panic: a silver pendant etched with protective runes hung deliberately from a standing stone, a weathered leather pouch containing silver coins rested in an alcove, a broken lantern stained with soot lay near a cairn, and beneath it, a small silver coin gleamed faintly. Additionally, they uncovered a half-burned map showing part of the forest trail, its edges singed as if hastily discarded. Analysis of these items revealed a dual nature--some were left intentionally as wards and tokens of hope, while others appeared dropped in haste during a frantic escape. Bootprints matching Elen's led northward toward the Withered Shrine, strengthening the link between the offerings, local fears, and her disappearance. The party chose to take the half-burned map and the small silver coin, sensing these might serve as markers or guides left behind for someone tracking Elen. As they pocketed these clues, the forest seemed to acknowledge their resolve, with ward markers pulsing faintly and the path northward beckoning through the deepening shadows. With no immediate threats present, the party prepared to follow the footprints leading onward into the Gloamwood's enigmatic depths."}

While surveying the area, Norn sensed a lurking presence, which soon manifested as two hostile twig blights emerging from the shadows. A fierce combat ensued in which Norn sustained injuries but ultimately defeated both blights. After the battle, Norn took stock of the surroundings, finding scattered offerings, faded runes etched into the altar, and a faint spiritual energy hinting at the shrine's lingering power. Investigating further, Norn discovered clear evidence of Scout Elen's recent passage: a torn scrap of blue cloth caught on stone, fresh bootprints pressed deeply into soft earth, a ration wrapper, and a battered silver amulet partially buried near the altar. These clues, along with a roughly scratched map on the altar, pointed north toward the Spectral Clearing and Lost Ward Circle and indicated that Elen had hurried through the area, likely pursued or under duress. Examining the altar's faded glyphs and the disturbed offerings, Norn discerned that Elen had attempted a ritual to reinforce the shrine's protective ward but had left it incomplete. Through a careful study of the ritual's components, Norn learned that completing the ward required offerings of earth (such as moss), flame (a living fire), and memory (a memento like the silver amulet), placed in order while invoking a vow at the altar's perimeter. Acting on this knowledge, Norn gathered the necessary items, recited the vow aloud while circling the altar, and restored the protective ward, which caused the blue witchlight to intensify and the oppressive atmosphere to lift. This restoration earned Norn the \"Blessing of the Forest Guardian,\" granting advantage against fear effects. Finally, Norn confirmed that Elen's footprints led north from the shrine, winding between stone pillars and into the forest path toward the Spectral Clearing and Lost Ward Circle, marking the next stage in the search. With the ward renewed and the trail clear, the party prepared to follow Elen's path deeper into the Gloamwood's haunted heart."}
