Noticing a weathered bronze key bearing a faded raven sigil hidden beneath the glass counter, the party inquired about its significance. Mirna revealed that the key, a family heirloom from the Greymonts who once built the nearby keep before its fall into darkness, opened a door within that very keep. She entrusted the key to the party, urging them to uncover the truth of the Greymont family and to share their findings to aid the village's healing. When pressed about the dangers tied to the keep, Mirna recounted chilling tales passed down from her grandmother describing unnatural shadows, disembodied voices, and vanished villagers, warning that the keep held an ancient and lingering malevolence. Acknowledging the weight of this responsibility, the party asked for guidance on supplies. Mirna advised taking a hooded lantern, ample rations, and offered a sturdy, lined leather pouch free of charge to protect the key. She also provided bandages and herbal salves for treating wounds, recommending seeking out Mara, the village herbalist at the nearby Wyrd Lantern Inn, for additional aid. After purchasing the lantern, ten days' rations, and the herbal supplies, the party prepared to proceed with caution and resolve, their inventory enriched and their purpose clear, before considering their next steps beyond the general store.

Mara shared crucial advice about the keep's supernatural hazards: chilling mists that distort perception, the importance of salt and iron to reinforce wards, the peril of breaking protective circles, and warnings about ghostly childlike laughter signaling danger. When asked about the Greymont family, Mara recounted their tragic history, emphasizing Lord Thaddeus's pride and the disappearance of his kin after the curse descended, with a lingering spirit named Elenora who might seek redemption.
