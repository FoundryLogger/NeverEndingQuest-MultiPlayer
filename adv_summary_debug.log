Shelves brim with tools, dried provisions, lanterns, and the occasional oddity from distant lands. The air smells of wax, old paper, and leather, and handwritten notices clutter a bulletin board near the counter. Elder Mirna Harrow watches over a bronze key adorned with a faded raven sigil that hints at deeper secrets tied to the town's troubled history.", "plotHooks": ["A worried villager asks if the party has news of Scout Elen, who vanished checking the old east trail.", "Elder Mirna discreetly seeks brave souls to investigate odd nighttime lights near the ruined keep.", "A worn parchment tacked to the notice board offers a reward for information about recent livestock thefts.", "Talk to Tommen, a villager who may have valuable information about recent disappearances and the lingering effects of the curse."], "dmInstructions": "Use Elder Mirna as the party's primary source of local lore and rumors about the keep. She may offer quests, provide supplies at a discount, or quietly warn against meddling with old magics. If players inquire about the bronze key, Mirna claims it's a forgotten relic, but a DC 12 Insight check reveals she's hiding something. The notice board is a valuable source of leads about ongoing threats and missing persons.", "encounters": [{"encounterId": "R01-E1", "summary": "The party met Elder Mirna Harrow at the general store. She welcomed them warmly yet cautiously, offering support and access to supplies. The party noticed a bronze key with a faded raven sigil that Mirna guarded protectively.
