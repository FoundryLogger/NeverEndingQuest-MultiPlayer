Her careful deflection and the way her fingers tense around the key reveal a truth she can't completely hide. It's clear she's withholding information and feels protective not just of the key but of whatever secrets it guards.\n\nAfter a moment of internal struggle, Mirna leans in, lowering her voice so only you can hear. \"You see more than most. That key is tied to the Greymont family, the old lords of the keep. My father kept it hidden, fearing what might be set loose if the wrong hands found it. But I can tell you're not here for selfish gain. If your path leads to the keep... well, the key may open more than just doors.\"\n\nShe lets her hand rest openly on the key now, a silent invitation for further questions or decisions.

Its bow is engraved with a once-sharp raven sigil, now faded and tarnished with age. Along the shaft, faint scrawls--perhaps initials or a family motto--are nearly illegible. The teeth are unusually intricate, suggesting it was crafted to open a lock of singular importance. A faint scent of old metal and wax lingers about it.\n\nAs you test the incomplete command 'examin', Mirna raises an eyebrow and gives you a quizzical look. \"Did you mean to examine something, dear?\" she prompts gently, encouraging you to clarify your intent.\n\nWhen you attempt to 'take key', 'ask Mirna for key', or 'get key': Mirna hesitates, then pushes the key gently across the counter to you. Her expression is grave, but not unfriendly. \"Take it, if you must. The keep's secrets won't stay buried forever, and you seem the sort who won't let fear stop him. Just... be careful. Some keys open more than doors.\"\n\nYou now have the old bronze key with the raven sigil in your possession.\n\nThe store seems to pause, as if awaiting your next move.

But after the Greymonts fell, it soured. There were whispers--servants vanishing, strange lights flickering atop the battlements, and a cold that crept down to the bones of the land.\"\n\nShe leans forward, lowering her voice. \"Folk who went poking about its ruins didn't return--at least, not whole. Some say the spirits of the Greymonts haunt those halls, twisted by grief and something darker. Others talk of traps, old magics, and worse. Even the bravest hunters won't venture near, not on a wager.\"\n\nMirna's fingers toy with a faded ribbon pinned to her sleeve. \"If you're set on going, beware the mists beyond the East Gate. Folk call it the Gloamwood now--it's never quite the same path twice, and sometimes the woods themselves whisper warnings. The keep draws the lost and the bold, but it seldom lets them go. If you find anything that belonged to the Greymonts, bring it back here. Some legacies should be laid to rest, not left to fester.\"\n\nA sense of foreboding lingers in her words, but also a quiet hope--a glimmer that you might succeed where others have failed.\n\nIs there anything else you wish to ask Mirna, or will you prepare to leave the shop and head toward your next destination?",

My father used to say the stones themselves remember every sorrow. After the Greymonts fell, no one with sense dared linger there. Folks tell of restless spirits, of wicked magics that never faded, and of traps set to catch the living as well as the dead.\"\n\nShe glances toward the windows, as if wary the shadows might be listening. \"But it's not just the keep you should fear. The Gloamwood between here and there twists the mind--trails that turn in on themselves, whispers that lead folk astray. Some vanish for days and stumble home wild-eyed, never the same. Others are found... or never found at all.\"\n\nMirna's hand tightens on the counter. \"If you go, keep your wits about you. The old Greymont blood ran deep with secrets, and not all of them died with the family. If you uncover anything--documents, heirlooms, even rumors--bring them back here. Some things must be laid to rest before the Hollow can ever truly heal.\"\n\nHer words linger in the air, grave and sincere. You sense she's told you as much as she dares for now, yet her concern is genuine--a blend of hope and fear for what your journey might awaken.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to ask or do while in the general store, or are you ready to prepare for the journey ahead?",
      "ai_action": "Action 2: Use a more confrontational tone with Mirna to test NPC emotional response and dialogue branching.\n\nCommand: \"Why did no one bother to secure the keep properly? Sounds like negligence.\"\n\nExpected: Mirna reacts defensively or emotionally, possibly providing additional context or reacting negatively to the tone.\n\nProceeding with this action now.",

But after the Greymont family fell, darkness crept in. Some say it was grief, others claim a curse. Now, the halls there are cold and haunted. Lights flicker where none should be, and the stone corridors echo with voices you don't want to meet.\"\n\nShe hesitates, looking you over, searching for any sign of doubt. \"Folk who go too near sometimes come back changed--or not at all. The woods between here and the keep, the Gloamwood, is no safer. Paths turn in on themselves, and shadows play tricks on the mind. When the new moon rises, even the bravest keep to the lantern-lit lanes.\"\n\nMirna lowers her voice. \"If you are set on this, remember: not every spirit there wishes you harm, but not all want to be freed, either. And some secrets... they're buried for a reason. Still, if you find something that might help the Hollow--evidence, heirlooms, even a rumor--bring it back. Sometimes, it's the truth that finally lays the dead to rest.\"\n\nHer words settle heavily in the small shop. You sense genuine worry for your safety, but also hope--perhaps you might succeed where others have faltered.",
