The air here is fresh, tinged with the resinous scent of pine and the faintest note of woodsmoke carried by a gentle breeze.\\n\\nScout's Watch is little more than a weathered outpost platform and a circle of trampled grass, but its vantage reveals much. To the west, the path back to the Rangers' Command Post is visible between the trees. Ahead, the land rises in a gentle slope toward the north, where the distant silhouette of the North Bell Tower is barely visible through a haze of enchanted thorns and dense undergrowth--a tangle that seems to shift ever so slightly, even when the wind is still.\\n\\nKira pauses, eyes sweeping the perimeter. \\\"No movement,\\\" she murmurs, relaxing slightly. \\\"This spot's been quiet for days--too quiet, if you ask me. It's a good place for a lookout, but I can't shake the feeling something's watching from the vines up ahead.\\\"\\n\\nThe clearing itself is peaceful: a battered log serves as a bench, and an old oil lamp hangs from a crooked branch. There are a few spent arrow shafts embedded in a nearby tree--a silent testament to past patrols. Birds flit among the higher branches, and for now, all is calm.\\n\\nYou have a few moments to catch your breath, check your gear, or scan the path ahead for any sign of danger before pushing on toward the bell tower.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
