      "game_output": "The morning bustle of Harrow's Hollow General Store greets you as you step inside, the soft clink of the bell overhead announcing your arrival. Sunlight filters through wavy glass panes, illuminating shelves stacked high with tools, rations, lanterns, and curiosities from far-off lands. The air is tinged with the scents of wax, leather, and dried herbs.\n\nBehind the counter, Elder Mirna Harrow stands, her posture dignified despite the faint lines of worry creasing her brow. She greets you with a nod, her voice steady. \"Back so soon, Norn? Anything in particular you're after today, or perhaps news from your journeys beyond the village?\"\n\nThe notice board to your left is crowded with handwritten scraps--missing pet posters, cryptic warnings, and a recent parchment offering a reward for information about livestock thefts. Among the goods, you spot an old bronze key with a faded raven sigil resting behind the counter, and a rolled map of local trails tucked among the ledgers.\n\nElder Mirna's eyes linger just a moment longer as you glance at the key. \"Some things are best left forgotten,\" she murmurs quietly, almost to herself.\n\nIf you wish, you could ask about provisions, investigate the key, check the map, or try to read between the lines of Mirna's words. The store is quiet, save for the ticking of a clock and distant voices from the square outside. What do you do?",
      "ai_action": "I will directly engage Elder Mirna to inquire about any quests or tasks she might have, using keywords to prompt quest-related information.\n\nNorn says: \"Elder Mirna, I am looking for any quests or help needed in the village. Are there any problems or missions you need assistance with?\"",

She sets aside her ledger, folding her hands on the counter.\n\n\"You've always been one to stand up when others might shrink away, Norn.\" Her voice carries genuine gratitude. \"With the darkness lifting from the forest, folk are beginning to breathe easier, but trouble doesn't vanish with the sunrise. There are still worries here, old and new alike.\"\n\nShe glances subtly toward the notice board and then lowers her voice. \"We've livestock gone missing--some think it's wolves, but others say they've seen shadows moving in the fields at night. And though the keep's curse is weakened, a few speak of strange lights on the horizon and a cold wind that sometimes rolls in after sunset.\"\n\nMirna's fingers drum softly on the wood. \"If you have the patience for it, Old Tommen's been fussing about a spirit haunting the lanes. I can't say how much truth there is, but he's not one for fanciful tales. And some are still worried about the tunnels beneath the inn, though you did much to calm that business. These folk--well, Norn, they look to you now.\"\n\nShe offers a faint smile. \"If you want to help, you might start by looking into the livestock thefts or see if Old Tommen will talk to you about his 'wandering shade.' And, of course, if anything else comes up, I'll let you know.\"\n\nThe general store feels a little less ordinary, the weight of Mirna's trust settling on your shoulders. Outside, the faint sound of a blacksmith's hammer rings out, reminding you the village is stirring to life.",
      "ai_action": "Quest information documented:\n\n- Main quest options from Elder Mirna:\n  1. Investigate livestock thefts - suspected wolves or shadowy figures seen at night.\n  2. Talk to Old Tommen about a spirit haunting the lanes.\n  3. Be aware of strange lights on the horizon and a cold wind after sunset.\n  4. Tunnels beneath the inn remain a concern, though previously addressed.\n\nQuest objectives are somewhat clear for the livestock thefts (investigation) and talking to Old Tommen (gather information). The other points are hints for future developments.\n\nNext step:\n- Confirm quest acceptance and verify quest tracking.\n- Ask Elder Mirna if she wants you to prioritize livestock theft investigation or the spirit haunting.\n\nNorn says: \"Elder Mirna, I am willing to help. Should I begin by investigating the livestock thefts, or would you prefer I speak with Old Tommen about the spirit first?\"",
