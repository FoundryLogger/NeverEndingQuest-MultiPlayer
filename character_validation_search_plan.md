# Character Creation and Validation Code Search Plan

## Objective
Find the code that handles character creation and validation in this D&D game system, specifically:
- Character data validation against schema
- Validation failure handling
- Game crash vs retry logic
- Character creation/setup process

## Search Strategy
1. Search for Python files with character validation logic
2. Look for schema validation patterns and error handling
3. Find character creation/setup processes
4. Locate specific error messages from the crash
5. Analyze validation flow and crash points

## Target Error Messages
- "Schema validation error: 2 is less than the minimum of 10"
- "Character setup cancelled. Exiting..."
- "[ERROR] Setup was cancelled or failed. Cannot start game loop."

## Status
- [ ] Search for validation files
- [ ] Search for schema validation
- [ ] Search for character creation
- [ ] Search for error messages
- [ ] Analyze validation flow
- [ ] Identify crash points
