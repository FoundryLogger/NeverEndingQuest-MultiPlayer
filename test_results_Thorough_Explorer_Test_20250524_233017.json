Above it, hammered discreetly into the frame, is a small iron nail stained with age; its head is marked with a faded spiral, a symbol you recall from Mara's tales of warding against restless spirits.\n\nYou find no runes glowing or etched into the stone, but you do notice the stonework itself is unusually tight, as if the wall had once been reinforced against intrusion--mundane or otherwise. The salt line, though worn, was clearly meant to guard the entrance; the iron nail, a silent sentinel against unnatural forces.\n\nThese are not the grand magical wards of legend, but simple folk protections--enough, perhaps, to keep the worst at bay or to buy time should something try to cross.\n\nWith this knowledge, you sense the reverence with which the villagers prepared their homes. You're reminded to proceed with caution and respect, both for the living and the lingering spirits whose peace you seek to restore.\n\nA distant bell chimes in the town square, calling your attention to the life of the village outside. The path ahead is yours to choose: investigate the square, seek out Old Tommen and his stories, check the notice board for those in need, or visit another location for more answers before you set your sights once again on the keep.",
      "ai_action": "I take a moment to absorb the significance of the salt line and iron nail, nodding quietly in respect for the villagers' care. \n\nWith renewed focus, I decide to heed Elder Mirna's advice and head toward the town square to seek out Old Tommen. I intend to approach him politely but directly, saying, \"Good morning, Old Tommen. I have heard you possess keen memories and insight into the strange happenings around Harrow's Hollow. I would be grateful if you could share what you know about the keep, the lights, or any voices carried on the wind. Your knowledge could help me protect our village.\"\n\nIf I find Tommen willing to speak, I will listen carefully, taking note of any details or warnings he offers.",

      "game_output": "You make a slow, methodical circuit around the general store, lantern in hand, eyes tracing every seam and shadow among the weathered stones and timber frames. You spot the patched line of salt at the back threshold and the old iron nail hammered above the door--a sign of simple warding--but elsewhere the foundation and eaves reveal only the honest wear of years. There are no secret doors, arcane markings, or hidden crevices that leap out to your trained senses.\n\nAs you return to the front, Elder Mirna looks up from her counter, sensing your diligence. She offers a small, knowing smile. \"Looking for something, Norn? Many fear what's hidden, but sometimes it's what stands in plain sight that matters most. If you've questions about this place or what lies beyond, you need only ask--I've lived here long enough to remember most things worth remembering.\"\n\nYou feel the gentle encouragement in her words, and the subtle reminder: sometimes the wisdom of those who dwell in a place is as valuable as any hidden clue. The square outside is alive with the day's beginnings--Old Tommen sits near the notice board, and villagers bustle between the inn and the barracks. The fate of Harrow's Hollow and the next step in your quest may well lie in the stories and needs of its people.",
      "ai_action": "I return Elder Mirna's smile with a respectful nod. \"Thank you, Elder Mirna. Your counsel is a beacon in these uncertain times.\"\n\nI step toward the door, lantern held steady, and say, \"I intend to speak with Old Tommen at the notice board. His memories may hold truths that can guide my path.\"\n\nBefore leaving, I ask, \"Is there anything you recall about Old Tommen's experiences or views that might prepare me for our conversation? I want to approach him with the respect and understanding his wisdom deserves.\"\n\nThen, I make my way to the town square, ready to listen carefully to Tommen's stories and any warnings he might share.",
