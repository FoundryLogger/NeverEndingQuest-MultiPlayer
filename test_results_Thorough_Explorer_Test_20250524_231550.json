      "game_output": "Sunlight, filtered through the overcast spring skies, spills into Harrow's Hollow General Store. The bustle of the town beyond is muted here--inside, the world feels a little more settled, a little more certain. The shelves are crowded with the necessities of frontier life: weathered boots, coils of rope, tins of tea, and stranger treasures from passing traders. The scent of wax and leather mingles with the faint tang of ink from the thick ledger on the counter.\n\nElder Mirna Harrow stands behind the counter, her posture straight but her eyes betraying fatigue. She greets you with a brisk nod, her tone warm enough, if guarded. \"Morning, Norn. I hope the general store has what you need. Supplies are running thin these days, so I've kept aside what I can for folks willing to lend a hand.\"\n\nThe notice board near the entrance draws your attention--a patchwork of hand-scrawled requests and warnings tacked alongside a reward posting for information about livestock thefts. Among the items behind the counter, you spot an old bronze key marked with a faded raven sigil. Elder Mirna shifts ever so slightly to obscure it.\n\nShe follows your gaze and offers a thin smile. \"Bit of an odd trinket, that key. Part of the store's odds and ends. Not much use, I imagine.\"\n\nThere's a brief silence, the kind that invites further questions--or closer scrutiny. Mirna's hand rests protectively atop the ledger, her knuckles tightening just a fraction.\n\nIf you wish to discern whether she's being forthright about the key and the history that surrounds it, you may try an Insight check. Or, perhaps, you'd like to ask about the missing Scout Elen, local happenings, or browse for supplies. What would you like to do?",
      "ai_action": "I approach the counter with a respectful nod to Elder Mirna. \"Good morning, Elder Mirna. Thank you for setting aside supplies; I appreciate your consideration.\" I glance at the bronze key again, then back to Mirna. \"That key seems quite interesting, especially with the raven sigil. If you don't mind my asking, is there any story behind it? It seems unusual compared to the other items here.\"\n\nIf her response seems guarded or evasive, I will consider an Insight check to discern her honesty. Otherwise, I may inquire about Scout Elen or local news, as I want to gather all relevant information to protect those who cannot protect themselves.",

      "game_output": "Elder Mirna's expression softens at your respectful manner, though a flicker of something unreadable passes across her features as you mention the key. She shifts her weight, fingers tracing the edge of the counter before replying. \"Oh, this old thing?\" She plucks the bronze key from behind the counter and turns it slowly in her hand, watching the way the light gleams on the worn raven sigil. \"It's been in the store as long as I've run it, and probably longer. Folks say it belonged to one of the old families--maybe Greymont or Harrow--though no one's really sure. Every so often, someone tries it on the storeroom door, but it's just as likely to jam as open anything. I'm afraid it's more curiosity than treasure.\"\n\nHer tone is measured and pleasant, but there's a tightness around her eyes--a carefulness in her words that suggests she's not telling you the whole story. The way she watches your reaction, guarded but hopeful you'll take her explanation at face value, makes you wonder what secrets might be hidden behind that tarnished metal and the history it represents.\n\nIf you'd like to press further or test her honesty, you may make an Insight check. Or, if you choose to let the subject rest, you might ask about Scout Elen or any recent happenings in Harrow's Hollow. What will you do next?",
      "ai_action": "I study Elder Mirna's expression carefully, noting the tightness around her eyes and the guarded hope in her gaze. I hesitate for a moment, not trusting my instincts fully, but feeling a responsibility to uncover the truth for the sake of the town. \n\n\"Thank you for sharing that, Elder Mirna. I can understand the key might be more than it seems.\" I pause, then add politely but firmly, \"If there is anything more you think I should know--especially if it could help keep Harrow's Hollow safe--I would be grateful for your honesty.\"\n\nI then say, \"If you prefer, I can respect your discretion about the key. In the meantime, could you tell me if Scout Elen has been heard from recently? Her disappearance worries me, as someone who fights for those who cannot defend themselves.\"\n\nIf Mirna remains evasive about the key, I am ready to make an Insight check.",

She sets the bronze key on the counter between you, the faded raven sigil catching the shop's lamplight.\n\n\"You deserve the truth, Norn,\" she says in a low voice, glancing around to ensure no one else is listening. \"That key isn't just a trinket. It belonged to the Greymont family--lords of the keep before the curse fell. The raven is their crest. My grandfather was the last to hold any official connection to them. Local legend says the key opens something important at the keep, though what exactly, I can't say. I've kept it hidden, hoping to keep foolish folk from poking at old wounds.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes, her own filled with a mixture of fear and hope. \"Scout Elen was the last to ask about it. She believed the disappearances and the recent curse were tied to something sealed away in the keep. She left for the woods with a borrowed lantern and hasn't returned.\"\n\nMirna slides the key toward you. \"If you're set on pursuing this, take it. Just... be careful. Some doors are shut for good reason.\"\n\nWith this revelation, you sense the gravity of the key's history--and its potential to change Harrow's Hollow's fate. Mirna's guarded demeanor has fallen away, replaced by a genuine anxiety for her people and hope that you might succeed where others have failed.",

Instead, I add, \"Scout Elen's disappearance is troubling. I will search for her and uncover whatever secrets the keep holds. The people of Harrow's Hollow deserve to know the truth and to be safe.\"\n\n\"I will prepare to visit the keep next. Before I go, is there anything else I should know about the keep or the recent curse that might help me?\" I ask politely, though my concern is clear in my voice.",

Folk say there are old tunnels beneath it--some lead to forgotten crypts, others to places best left undisturbed. If you must go, follow the river's edge through the Gloamwood. The direct path is watched by spirits--better to avoid their gaze if you can.\"\n\nShe fidgets with the corner of her ledger, then adds, \"There are stories of wards--old magic circles meant to keep the worst at bay. If you find any, try to restore them. It might weaken whatever darkness lingers there. And if you see Elen... tell her the village hasn't given up hope. Nor will I.\"\n\nMirna offers you a final, earnest nod. \"May the spirits guard your steps, Norn. If you need supplies before leaving, say the word.
