Beware the paths after sunset. Not all who vanish are taken by force, and not all spirits rest. Watch for the glint of eyes in the dark.'\n\nNo signature marks the note, but a small, charcoal-drawn raven sits in the margin. The warning is vague yet unsettling, echoing the superstitions whispered in the square. As you ponder its meaning, Old Tommen--his hair wild as ever--sidles closer, eyeing the board. \"Some folk see too much,\" he mutters, voice low. \"Best you don't walk alone come nightfall, Norn.\"\n\nThe board now stands fully examined, each message revealing a fragment of village life and lingering unease.

Confrontational: \"If these shadows are so dangerous, why don't you do something about them?\"\n\nExpected results:  \n- The system should recognize the NPC and provide appropriate dialogue responses for each approach, reflecting Tommen's character and mood.  \n- Dialogue branches should vary in tone and content, allowing for multiple lines and testing conversation depth.\n\nProceeding with: \"talk to Old Tommen - polite inquiry.\"",

He shifts from foot to foot, voice dropping to a whisper meant for your ears alone. \"Ah, polite you are, and that's rare enough these days. Folk say I see things that ain't there, but I know what walks the moor at night. Sometimes it's just the wind and a lost sheep, but other times...\"\n\nHe glances about, ensuring no one is listening. \"There are lights out by the marsh that move against the wind, and shapes--tall and thin, with eyes that catch the moonlight even when there ain't no moon. Folk vanish, not a sound nor sign, just a cold patch on the grass come morning. The old keep's curse, some say, but I think it's more than that. Spirits don't always walk where they're told.\"\n\nHe sighs heavily, his nerves easing a fraction. \"If you must walk after dark, carry iron and salt, and never answer if they call your name. That's what my gran taught me. Might sound daft, but I've lasted this long.\"\n\nTommen offers a grateful nod, his wariness giving way to a flicker of trust.

Well, folk are still jumpy as hares in a thicket, but there's hope again, now the curse is lifting.

Speak with each guard, testing polite, inquisitive, and confrontational dialogue options to verify branching and NPC responses.\n\n2. Inspect the gate and wall defenses using synonyms: \"examine gate,\" \"look at guardhouse,\" \"inspect wall.\"\n\n3. Check the chalkboard tally for recent entries with commands: \"examine chalkboard,\" \"look at chalkboard,\" \"inspect chalkboard.\"\n\n4. Look out toward the fields and woods to test descriptive content and potential interaction triggers.\n\nI will begin by speaking politely to the guard who saluted.\n\nCommand: \"talk to guard - polite greeting.\"",

It's an honor, truly. Quiet for now--just the crows and the usual travelers. Since the curse lifted, folk have been less restless, but we keep watch all the same.\"\n\nHe glances toward the open gate, then lowers his voice. \"Still, the woods have a mind of their own. We lost two sheep again last night--no tracks, no blood, just vanished. Sergeant Halric says the patrols'll double after dusk, but if you hear anything out there, or see signs, we'd be grateful for your word.\"\n\nHis tone is respectful, laced with the uncertainty of a man still adjusting to hope after too many nights of fear. He gestures toward the chalkboard. \"You can see who's come and gone for yourself, if that's your business.\"\n\nWould you like to speak to the second guard, ask more questions, inspect the defenses, examine the chalkboard, or look out beyond the gate?",
