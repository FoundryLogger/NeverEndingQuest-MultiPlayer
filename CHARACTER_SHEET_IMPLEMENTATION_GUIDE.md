# Character Sheet Implementation Guide

## Current Implementation Status

Based on the analysis, here's what was found:

### Active Implementations
1. **Main Game Interface** (`/templates/game_interface.html`): Contains comprehensive character sheet implementation
2. **Refactored Version** (`/templates/game_interface_original_refactored.html`): Loads simplified version from external JS file
3. **Extracted JS** (`/static/js/original-character-data.js`): Simplified character display functions

## How to Restore Full Character Sheet Display

### Method 1: Use Current Implementation (Recommended)
The current `game_interface.html` already contains the full comprehensive character sheet implementation. If it's not displaying correctly, the issue is likely:

1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Character data may not match expected format
2. **CSS Missing**: Required styles may not be loading
3. **JavaScript Errors**: Check browser console for errors

### Method 2: Restore from Original Template
Copy the comprehensive character sheet sections from the original:

#### Key Sections to Copy:
```html
<!-- From game_interface_original.html lines 2605-2812 -->
<script>
function displayCharacterStats(data) {
    // Full comprehensive implementation
    // Including all features: skills, saves, class features, racial traits, etc.
}
</script>
```

### Method 3: Enhance Current Simplified Version
Extend the functions in `original-character-data.js` to include missing features.

## Required Data Structure

For the comprehensive character sheet to work, character data must include:

```javascript
{
    // Basic Info
    "name": "Character Name",
    "level": 4,
    "race": "Human", 
    "class": "Fighter",
    "background": "Soldier",
    "alignment": "Lawful Good",
    "experience_points": 4971,
    "exp_required_for_next_level": 6500,
    "proficiencyBonus": 2,
    
    // Ability Scores
    "abilities": {
        "strength": 17,
        "dexterity": 14,
        "constitution": 16,
        "intelligence": 11,
        "wisdom": 13,
        "charisma": 9
    },
    
    // Combat Stats
    "hitPoints": 22,
    "maxHitPoints": 36,
    "armorClass": 16,
    "initiative": 2,
    
    // Proficiencies
    "savingThrows": ["Strength", "Constitution"],
    "skills": {
        "Athletics": 5,
        "Insight": 3,
        "Intimidation": 1,
        "Survival": 3
    },
    
    // Features and Abilities
    "classFeatures": [
        {
            "name": "Second Wind",
            "description": "Regain hit points as bonus action",
            "usage": {
                "current": 1,
                "max": 1,
                "refreshOn": "short rest"
            }
        }
    ],
    
    "racialTraits": [
        {
            "name": "Extra Language",
            "description": "You can speak an additional language"
        }
    ],
    
    "backgroundFeature": {
        "name": "Military Rank",
        "description": "You have military rank and authority"
    },
    
    "feats": [
        {
            "name": "Great Weapon Master",
            "description": "Master of two-handed weapons"
        }
    ],
    
    "temporaryEffects": [
        {
            "name": "Bless",
            "description": "+1d4 to attack rolls and saves",
            "duration": "1 minute",
            "expiration": "2024-06-20T14:30:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

## CSS Requirements

The comprehensive character sheet requires specific CSS classes:

### Essential Classes
- `.character-sheet` - Main container
- `.character-header` - Header section
- `.character-name` - Large character name
- `.abilities-row` - 6-column ability grid
- `.ability-score` - Individual ability containers
- `.combat-stats` - Combat statistics grid
- `.skills-saves-container` - Two-column layout
- `.abilities-grid` - Feature categories grid
- `.stat-group` - Feature group containers
- `.feature-item` - Individual feature items

### Key Features
- Hover effects on ability scores
- Visual HP bar with percentage-based width
- Proficiency indicators (● ○) for saves
- Usage counters for class features
- Time remaining displays for effects

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Verify Current Implementation
```bash
# Check which version is active
grep -n "displayCharacterStats" /mnt/c/dungeon_master_v1/templates/game_interface.html
```

### 2. Test Character Data Structure
Ensure character JSON includes all required fields listed above.

### 3. Check CSS Loading
Verify all character sheet CSS classes are present and loading.

### 4. Test JavaScript Functions
Check browser console for JavaScript errors in character display.

### 5. Validate Features
Test each feature category:
- [ ] Character header displays correctly
- [ ] Ability scores show with modifiers
- [ ] Combat stats display with HP bar
- [ ] Saving throws show proficiency indicators
- [ ] Skills list displays with bonuses
- [ ] Class features show with usage tracking
- [ ] Active effects display with time remaining
- [ ] Racial traits display (filtered)
- [ ] Background feature displays
- [ ] Feats display with descriptions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Simplified Display Only
**Symptom**: Only basic character info shows
**Solution**: Check if simplified version is being used; switch to comprehensive version

### 2. Layout Issues
**Symptom**: Features not arranged in grid
**Solution**: Verify `.abilities-grid` and `.skills-saves-container` CSS is loaded

### 3. Missing Data Sections
**Symptom**: Some sections show "No [feature] available"
**Solution**: Ensure character data includes required nested objects

### 4. No Visual Effects
**Symptom**: No hover effects or HP bar
**Solution**: Check that CSS transitions and animations are loaded

### 5. Time Tracking Not Working
**Symptom**: Active effects don't show time remaining
**Solution**: Verify game time is available in `window.currentGameTime`

## Performance Considerations

### Comprehensive Implementation
- **Pros**: Full feature set, professional appearance, complete D&D 5e integration
- **Cons**: Larger data requirements, more complex rendering, higher memory usage

### Simplified Implementation  
- **Pros**: Fast rendering, minimal data needed, lightweight
- **Cons**: Limited functionality, basic appearance, missing D&D features

## Recommendation

For a complete D&D 5e experience, use the comprehensive implementation from `game_interface.html`. The simplified version should only be used for basic character info display or performance-critical situations.

## Files to Monitor

When implementing changes:
- `/templates/game_interface.html` - Primary game interface
- `/static/js/original-character-data.js` - Simplified functions
- Character JSON files - Ensure proper data structure
- CSS files - Verify character sheet styling

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying character sheet changes:
- [ ] All character data fields populate correctly
- [ ] Visual styling matches original design
- [ ] Interactive features work (hover effects, tooltips)
- [ ] Usage tracking updates properly
- [ ] Time calculations display correctly
- [ ] Responsive layout works on different screen sizes
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
