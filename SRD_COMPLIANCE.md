## Compliance Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Added CC BY 4.0 LICENSE file
- [x] Updated README with SRD attribution
- [x] Replaced trademarked terms in code
- [x] Added attribution to core monster files
- [x] Created compliance documentation

### üîç Requires Verification
- [ ] Cross-reference all monsters against SRD 5.2.1
- [ ] Verify spell lists in character files
- [ ] Check class features for SRD compliance
- [ ] Audit equipment lists

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues
- Some monster variants may be homebrew content
- Custom campaign content needs clear attribution
- System prompts may reference non-SRD content

## Attribution Implementation

### Monster Files
All SRD-derived monster files include:
```json
{
  "_srd_attribution": "Portions of this monster data derived from SRD 5.2.1, licensed under CC BY 4.0",
  ...
}
```

### Code Files
Files using SRD content include headers:
```python
# Portions of this work derived from SRD 5.2.1, licensed under CC BY 4.0
```

## Trademark Compliance

### Avoided Terms
- "D&D" replaced with "5th edition" or "5e"
- "Dungeons & Dragons" replaced with "fifth edition"
- No references to proprietary settings (Forgotten Realms, etc.)

### Campaign Content
- "Keep of Doom" campaign uses generic fantasy setting
- Location names are original or generic
- NPCs are original creations

## Ongoing Compliance

### For Developers
1. Always check SRD 5.2.1 before adding new monsters
2. Mark all SRD-derived content with attribution
3. Use generic terms instead of trademarked names
4. Document original vs. SRD content clearly

### For Content Creators
1. Campaign content should be original or SRD-derived
2. Avoid proprietary setting references
3. Clearly mark homebrew vs. SRD content
4. Maintain attribution in all derived files
