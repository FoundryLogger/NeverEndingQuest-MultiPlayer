# 
# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: Game Systems Layer - Location and Movement Management
# 
# This module manages 5e exploration mechanics including location transitions,
# area connectivity, and spatial relationships. It implements our hierarchical
# module organization with ID-based location management.
# 
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - Manage location data loading and caching
# - Handle area-to-area and location-to-location transitions
# - Validate movement requests against connectivity rules
# - Coordinate with path finding system for movement validation
# - Maintain location state and discovery tracking
# 
# LOCATION HIERARCHY:
# Module -> Areas (HH001, G001) -> Locations (A01, B02) -> Local Features
# 
# ID CONVENTION:
# - Area IDs: 3-letter prefix + 3-digit number (HH001, G001, TBM001)
# - Location IDs: Letter + 2-digit number (A01, B02, C15)
# - Encounter IDs: Location-Encounter format (B02-E1)
# 
# CONNECTIVITY SYSTEM:
# - Within-area connectivity through location connections
# - Cross-area connectivity through special transition locations
# - Graph-based pathfinding for movement validation
# - Support for hidden passages and conditional connections
# 
# ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION:
# - Called by action_handler.py for location transitions
# - Uses ModulePathManager for area file loading
# - Integrates with party_tracker.json for current location state
# - Coordinates with location_path_finder.py for validation
# 
# DESIGN PATTERNS:
# - Facade Pattern: Simplifies complex location operations
# - Flyweight Pattern: Efficient location data caching
# - Observer Pattern: Location change notifications
# 
# This module demonstrates our approach to complex spatial relationships
# while maintaining performance and data consistency.
