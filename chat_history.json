Ranger Elen, standing over battered maps stained with blood and soot, briefed him grimly on a string of escalating caravan attacks--three lost in five days--with the rangers stretched to their limits and a dire threat looming. Alongside her were the grizzled Ranger Marcus, who spoke of vanishing tracks and unnerving bandit discipline, and Scout Kira, whose wide-eyed reports of strange, ghostly lights and fleeing wildlife hinted at a supernatural presence unsettling the Thornwood's ancient wilds. Messenger Tom's weary testimony underscored the growing panic: merchants might cease their routes, supplies dwindled, and hope frayed.\n\nDespite the grim welcome, Eirik's levity broke the tension, promising ale and camaraderie once the crisis passed--a rare spark of warmth in the cold command post. Pressed into action, he chose to interrogate Rusk, the captured bandit leader. Using persuasion laced with a priest's unique brand of mercy--offering to heal wounds he could just as easily inflict--Eirik coaxed wary grudging admissions from Rusk. The bandit revealed a hidden camp north of Scout's Watch, guarded by hardened cutthroats and a mysterious masked faction called \"The Crow's Hand,\" whose presence marked a sinister escalation. Rusk's testimony painted a picture of ruthless efficiency and fear, punctuated by whispers of strange blue-white lights that even the bandits feared--signs of a darker force at work beyond mere brigandry.\n\nNegotiations deepened when Eirik proposed provisioning for a horse and supplies, an offer Elen cautiously approved given the stakes, cementing trust and enabling Eirik's forthcoming scout mission. Rusk's survival hinged on a promise of safe passage and secrecy, underscoring the perilous nature of alliance and truth in these desperate times.\n\nWith Rusk's insights, the rangers gained a clearer map of threats--twenty-five bandits, deadly cutthroats, and the enigmatic Crow's Hand lurking deep in the wilds. The next caravan's arrival loomed by dusk the following day, heightening the pressure.\n\nChoosing to bolster the outpost's defenses, Eirik and newly allied Scout Kira began restoring the sabotaged silver bell early-warning network--vital lifelines cut with deliberate precision and marked by subtle clues like black thread caught on"

Their first encounter was with Trader Sila, a heavyset woman cloaked in worn green, who eyed them warily near a locked chest. Eirik's warm greeting and compliment softened her guarded demeanor, and through guarded conversation, Sila revealed glimpses of shadowy figures skulking near the old crates by dawn, and repeated sightings of cloaked figures--suspected members of the enigmatic Crow's Hand--prowling after dark.\n\nChoosing caution over haste, the pair investigated the crates, discovering a snapped silver bell wire coated in an oily black residue and faint, small footprints hastily covered but betraying a lightweight saboteur's flight. Most damning was a torn scrap of dark cloth caught on a nail, embroidered with a silver-stitched crow's feather--an unmistakable mark tied to the Crow's Hand. Drag marks hinted that a heavy object had been covertly hauled toward the old Forgotten Waystation, suggesting the saboteur had not yet disappeared far.\n\nWith care, Eirik pocketed the cloth as evidence, and alongside Kira's vigilant watch and deft hands, repaired the bell wire. The bell's soft chime broke the heavy silence, restoring a vital line of defense threatened by unseen enemies. Returning to Sila, they confirmed her darkest fears: the Crow's Hand was actively sabotaging the outpost, and vigilance was paramount. Sila vowed to rally the traders to caution, acknowledging the looming threat with a blend of relief and anxiety.\n\nHeartened but unyielding, Eirik and Kira chose not to delay. Following the fresh drag marks into the chilling brush toward the Forgotten Waystation, they pressed forward with resolute purpose--each step steeped in tense anticipation--ready to uncover more of the saboteur's secrets before the trail grew cold and the danger multiplied. The quiet market's uneasy calm had given way to a hunt that would test their courage and wits in the shadow of the Crow's Hand."
