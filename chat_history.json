She gestures for you to approach, voice pitched for your ears alone. \\\"You must have seen the signs on your way here--another caravan lost last night. My rangers are stretched thin, and every move we make is watched. We have a prisoner--Rusk. He's broken, terrified of someone he calls 'the master.' I need to know what he knows about the bandit command structure and, more importantly, their new leader.\\\"\\n\\nHer gaze grows more intent. \\\"If you can get anything useful from him--where they're camped, who this sorcerer is--we might have a chance to hit back before the next attack.\\\"\\n\\nThe steady presence of Ranger Marcus nearby hints at quiet backup, while the other rangers keep a respectful distance. The air is thick with unspoken urgency; the outpost's survival may hinge on what you can wring from the trembling man in chains.\\n\\nEirik, do you wish to approach Rusk now and begin the interrogation, or do you want to consult the maps and the rangers first?

Yes, Rusk's in bad shape. We caught him leading a raid north of here. He put up a fight--broke his arm, but the real damage was done by fear. He hasn't slept since we took him.

Magic's involved, and it's made Rusk desperate to talk--but also terrified to say too much.\\\"\\n\\nRanger Marcus, standing nearby, grunts and adds, \\\"If you want my advice, don't come at him like an interrogator. He expects pain. Show him you can keep him alive--convince him Malarok can't get to him in our walls. You might get more than the last two rangers did.\\\"\\n\\nElen nods in agreement. \\\"Whatever you do, we need the location of the bandit camp and confirmation about this sorcerer. The more details, the better. If you need backup, I'm here. Otherwise... it's your show.\\\"\\n\\nRusk sits hunched in the corner, eyes darting, lips moving in inaudible prayers.

The party must interrogate Rusk to learn the location of the main bandit camp and the identity of the sorcerer, Malarok, who now commands them.\n- Frontier Secured: With Malarok defeated and his influence broken, the woods begin to calm. The party returns to Rangers' Outpost as heroes. The remaining bandits have scattered or surrendered. Ranger Elen can finally secure the frontier, and news of the party's deeds begins to spread, opening doors to new adventures.\nActive side quests for this location:\n- Restore the Silver Bell Network (Status: not started): The outpost's three silver bell towers, a magical long-range communication system, have been sabotaged by Malarok's agents.
