Let's see what secrets the Silver Vein holds for us!\\\" Elder Mirna, who has been watching from the guardhouse steps, offers a parting blessing, and several villagers wave as you and Elen set out. The afternoon sun casts your long shadows ahead, and the Witchlight Trail opens before you, winding away from the safety of Harrow's Hollow into the wild promise of new adventure.\\n\\nTogether, you and Elen stride forward, your boots crunching on the gravel path, hearts steady and eyes sharp for the unknown. The familiar woods soon give way to mist-shrouded marshes and the distant glimmer of a broad, silver river--the fabled Silver Vein. Lanterns flicker along the trail as evening approaches, and the air carries the scent of peat, water, and possibility. After several hours' travel, the familiar world of Harrow's Hollow fades behind you, replaced by the hush and expectation of Sablemoor's edge.\\n\\nAt last, as dusk falls, you and Elen arrive at the Riverside Outpost: a weathered structure perched above the riverbank, lantern-light dancing across its sign. This marks your first step into the Sablemoor Reaches and the start of a new legend. The air hums with mystery, and Elen breathes out a soft laugh. \\\"We made it, Norn.

The air is thick with the scent of peat and river fog, and the hush of dusk brings strange, distant whispers that seem to ride the rising mist from the Silver Vein far below. Elen crouches by your side, her eyes scanning the moor for any movement, while you arrange a circle of damp stones, gathering dry kindling and a few brittle twigs from beneath the outpost's eaves.\\n\\nWith practiced hands, you strike flint, coaxing a flickering spark to life. The flames slowly catch, casting a warm glow across your faces and pushing back the silver-grey gloom. For a moment, the oppressive sorrow of the moor lifts, replaced by the reassuring crackle of firelight and the comfort of familiar ritual.\\n\\nElen exhales, her guard dropping slightly. \\\"That fire's a blessing out here,\\\" she murmurs. \\\"Even the river's whispers sound less mournful in the light. Let's keep watch, but for now... maybe we can rest easy.\\\"\\n\\nThe glow of your campfire stands as a beacon in the mist, a promise of warmth and safety on the threshold of the Sablemoor Reaches. The distant hoot of a marsh owl and the gentle pop of burning wood blend into the quiet, and for the first time since leaving Harrow's Hollow, you both feel a fragile peace settle around you.\\n\\nWhat will you do next? Will you share stories, investigate the outpost, or prepare for the challenges the moor surely holds?\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 10\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
