      "dmInstructions": "Keeper Morvath serves as both guide and gatekeeper to the keep. He offers hospitality (food, rest, and information) but tests the party through cryptic conversations. Players who show respect, offer assistance, or demonstrate genuine concern for Scout Elen earn his favor (and gifts), including ritual components and a potent healing concoction. Those who threaten or dismiss him face hostility. Morvath can provide directions to the keep and warnings about specific dangers, but he speaks in riddles that require Insight checks (DC 14) to fully understand. The awakened shrubs now number two and are vigilant, reacting only if the party threatens the Keeper or abuses his hospitality. Morvath has applied healing herbal paste to the party, restoring vitality after their recent battle.",
