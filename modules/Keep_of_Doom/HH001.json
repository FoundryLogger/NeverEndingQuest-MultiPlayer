Elder Mirna Harrow stood behind the counter, arranging lanterns with calm authority, and warmly welcomed Norn and Elen as the village's heroes. As Norn recounted their recent harrowing exploits--the dark corridors, spectral battles, and Elen's steadfast courage--Mirna listened with solemn pride. She praised their bravery and then presented them with a heavy, battered coffer unlocked before them, revealing 150 gold coins, two sparkling gemstones, and a deed to a plot of land west of the village, symbolizing the community's deep gratitude and trust. The villagers gathered, breaking into cheers that lifted the shadow that had long hung over Harrow's Hollow. With the rewards secured, Mirna confirmed that the deed was officially in Norn's possession, signed and sealed by the village council. A lively discussion ensued about the possibility of settling the old cursed keep nearby as a new stronghold. Elen's hopeful laughter and Mirna's supportive nod set the stage for this new endeavor, envisioning the keep as a bastion for renewal amid lingering ghosts. Norn then presented a jeweled dagger found in the keep to Mirna, who identified it as an enchanted ceremonial weapon from the ancient Vael family, safe and of minor magical nature, with potential secrets yet to be revealed by the village sage. After an inventory glitch was resolved with Mirna's help, Norn generously gifted Elen the cloak of elvenkind, which she accepted with heartfelt gratitude, promising to wield its magic well. Their quiet moment of shared affection was met with warm approval from Elder Mirna, as the general store's atmosphere brimmed with hope, camaraderie, and the promise of new beginnings before the party prepared to move on from Harrow's Hollow."
