Scout Kira's arrow found its mark, wounding the lead bandit and setting the stage for Eirik's decisive bolt, which felled him. The second bandit, wounded but fierce, pressed the attack, landing a painful crossbow hit on Eirik before Kira's shortsword drew blood. Eirik's sacred flame forced the bandit to the brink, and in the third round, after the bandit’s feeble attack and Kira’s close attempt, Eirik's mace strike dealt a finishing blow, sending the last foe crashing down.
