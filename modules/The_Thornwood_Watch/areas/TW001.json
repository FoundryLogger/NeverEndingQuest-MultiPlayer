Ancient trees lean inward like conspirators, their moss-choked bark weeping strange saps while root-latticed shadows conceal signs of recent violence. The air tastes of copper and fear, thick with the scent of spilled blood and the acrid smoke of bandit camps. Every snapping twig and rustling leaf might herald ambush, while drag marks in the earth tell grim stories of those who ventured here before you.",

Kira's vigilant gaze swept the scene, her voice lowered to a whisper as she urged a meticulous search, acknowledging the bandits' cunning and the forest's secrets. Together, they moved with practiced care, probing beneath the wagon and through scattered debris, their hands brushing against earth loosened by recent struggle. Their efforts--bolstered by Eirik's keen soldier's eye--uncovered a broken bandit dagger marked with Malarok's twisted sigil, a sealed bandage packet, trail rations, and a valuable scrap of cloth that hinted at the fate of missing captives. Kira herself found a stray crossbow bolt and a small pouch of silver coins, each item a fragment of the bandits' hurried retreat and a clue toward their trail. As shadows deepened, the pair noted drag marks leading toward the Bandit Trail, mingled with varied bootprints, confirming the direction of pursuit. Throughout their search, an unspoken bond of mutual trust and resolve quietly deepened between Eirik and Kira, their shared diligence and subtle smiles reflective of comradeship forged in hardship. With evidence collected and hearts steeled, they decided to leave the haunt of past violence behind and press onward toward the wolf's den, determined to explore more thoroughly this time, undeterred by memories of the wolves' prior attack.",

The bandit launched frantic and wild attacks, initially catching Eirik off guard and cutting him, but was steadily worn down by Eirik's steadfast mace strikes and Kira's precise archery. Kira, though gravely wounded by the Ashlings' necrotic assaults, held her ground, delivering fatal shots that dissolved one Ashling and ultimately felled the bandit. Eirik's timely healing spells and radiant Sacred Flame worked to counter the spirits' chilling attacks. The last Ashling, nearly destroyed by Kira's final arrow after Eirik's sacred fire, dissipated in a wisp of shadow and whispered regret. With the bandit dead and both spirits vanquished, the clearing grew still, the oppressive cold lifting as victory was claimed.
