Ancient trees lean inward like conspirators, their moss-choked bark weeping strange saps while root-latticed shadows conceal signs of recent violence. The air tastes of copper and fear, thick with the scent of spilled blood and the acrid smoke of bandit camps. Every snapping twig and rustling leaf might herald ambush, while drag marks in the earth tell grim stories of those who ventured here before you.",
