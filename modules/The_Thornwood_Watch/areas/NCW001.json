Black-needled pines writhe skyward like grasping fingers, their trunks weeping dark sap that pulses with corrupt energy. The air hums with Malarok's power, making metal grow cold and thoughts sluggish. At the heart of this blighted grove lie the crumbling ruins where the sorcerer conducts his dark rituals, protected by magical wards and corrupted guardians.",
