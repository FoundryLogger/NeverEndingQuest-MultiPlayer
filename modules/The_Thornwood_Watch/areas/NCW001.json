  "areaDescription": "The Northern Corrupted Woods exist as the epicenter of Malarok's dark influence, where ancient trees have been twisted into grotesque forms by the sorcerer's Voidstone magic. Black-needled pines writhe skyward like grasping fingers, their trunks weeping dark sap that pulses with corrupt energy. The air hums with Malarok's power, making metal grow cold and thoughts sluggish. At the heart of this blighted grove lie the crumbling ruins where the sorcerer conducts his dark rituals, protected by magical wards and corrupted guardians.",
