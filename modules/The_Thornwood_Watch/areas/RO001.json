      "adventureSummary": "Upon arriving at Trader's Rest, the party found themselves amidst a rustic frontier outpost fraught with tension after three caravans were brutally massacred. They met Ranger Elen, who detailed the dire situation, and secured the captured Bandit Leader Rusk for interrogation. The silver bell network remains disrupted, impairing communication, and Trader Sila's resolve wavers amid the growing danger.
