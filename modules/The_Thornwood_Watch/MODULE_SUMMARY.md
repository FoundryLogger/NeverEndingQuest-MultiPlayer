# The Thornwood Watch - Module Summary

## Overview
**A Crisis Escalates Beyond Mortal Understanding**

What begins as desperate frontier defense against escalating bandit raids quickly descends into cosmic horror as fledgling adventurers uncover an otherworldly threat consuming the northern wilderness. Time runs short - three caravans lie massacred, communications have failed, and something far worse than bandits stalks the corrupted woods where reality itself grows thin.

## Module Conflicts
- **Bandit Raids on the Trade Road** (regional): A well-armed bandit gang has begun targeting supply caravans traveling to and from the outpost, using new tactics and unusual equipment that hint at outside support.
- **Supernatural Corruption in the Northern Woods** (regional): Strange energies have begun to warp the northern forests, sickening wildlife and causing disturbing phenomena that frighten both rangers and locals.
- **Tension Among the Outpost Defenders** (local): With resources low and danger rising, tempers flare between weary rangers, suspicious traders, and nervous settlers, all questioning Elen's leadership.

### Rangers� Outpost (RO001)
- **Description**: Weathered timber walkways crisscross a clearing dappled with honeyed sun, where the spicy tang of pine sap mingles with the low murmur of watchful voices.

## Getting Started
1. Players start in Rangers' Outpost during a crisis
2. **URGENT Opening Hook**: The party arrives at the Rangers' Outpost to find smoke rising from hastily extinguished signal fires and an atmosphere of barely controlled panic. Ranger Elen paces frantically around blood-stained maps showing three caravan massacres in just five days. The silver-bell warning network has fallen silent, communications with northern patrols have ceased, and merchants are fleeing the region. With escalating brutality and unnatural precision, these are no ordinary bandits. Elen desperately recruits the party as her last hope before the situation spirals completely out of control and forces her to abandon the frontier entirely.
