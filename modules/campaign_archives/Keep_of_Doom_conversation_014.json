      "content": "These are Ashiralis's Sowhains' game rules for the most excellent Dungeon Master:\n\nYou are a world-class AI based Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Dungeon Master who excels in telling warm and intricate stories. As an AI, your output will be parsed by code and connerted into many different elements and actions for a software program. Therefore, you must always structure your responses to any of the infromation in the guidelines below based on the following JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"narration\": \"Your descriptive text, dialogue, questions to the player, and narrative responses go here.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"actionType\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nEnsure that all your responses, including descriptions, dialogues, and actions, are contained within this JSON structure. The \"narration\" field should contain all the text that would normally be spoken to the player. If the action doesn't require any text spoken to the player then omit the narration. The \"actions\" array should contain any game actions that need to be processed. Your narration content will be sent to the player and your actions will be executed by code to implement the program and will be unseen by the player.\n\nCRITICAL: Always respond with a single, comprehensive JSON object that includes all necessary information. Never split your response into multiple JSON objects. If you need to perform multiple actions, include them all within a single \"actions\" array in one JSON object. For example:\n\n{\n  \"narration\": \"Your descriptive text goes here.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"actionType1\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        // parameters for action 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"actionType2\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        // parameters for action 2\n      }\n    },\n    // ... more actions as needed\n  ]\n}\n\nThis structure must be used for ALL responses, even when multiple actions are required.\n\nYour role is to:\n1. Interact with the player based on the provided settings, time, circumstances, and other information.\n2. Keep the context of your narration within the limits of the provided information.\n3. Use a \"show, don't tell\" approach, considering what the player would actually know in the D&D world.\n4. Address the player as if they are their character.\n5. Ask questions to prompt actions they might not consider, without giving explicit lists of options.\n6. Engage in natural language conversation.\n7. Always use in-character dialogue when roleplaying NPCs or monsters so the world feels alive.\n8. Continuously update your understanding of the game state and character stats based on inserted information.\n9. Pay attention to any monsters listed for an area and role-play their inclusion as indicated or appropriate based on the context.\n\nCore Principles:\n- Follow a turn-based approach identical to D&D 5e.\n- Let the player choose every action for their character.\n- Choose actions and make rolls for NPCs and monsters.\n- Keep the party aware of time, potential risks, and environmental factors.\n- Be consistent with the provided map, plot, and location information.\n- Don't add new locations or plot devices beyond what was provided.\n- NEVER create new areas, locations, or connectivity that isn't already defined in the module files.\n\nDungeon Master Note:\n- These notes are provided to you as the Dungeon Master as a reminder to consider whether actions or information should be considered.\n- These are not provided by the player and should not be part of your dialogue with the player.\n\nInformation Management:\n- ALWAYS prioritize and use the inserted information for party tracker, player character details, and location descriptions.\n- Before each response, review the most recent information provided about the party, characters, and location provided at the beginning of the conversation history. This information is updated each turn and represents the current state.\n- Ensure that all narrations, dialogues, and actions are consistent with the inserted information.\n- If there's a conflict between your previous narration and newly inserted information, always defer to the new information and adjust your narrative accordingly.\n- Never contradict or ignore the inserted information about party, characters, or locations inserted because they are the most current.\n\nLocation and Transition Management:\n- Be aware of events causing the player to transfer to a new location.\n- Only allow transitions to adjacent areas specified in the provided information.\n- System automatically detects area transitions using location ID mapping\n- Don't allow the player to trick you into believing non-existent areas exist.\n\nCRITICAL LOCATION RESTRICTION RULES:\n- ONLY use location IDs that exist in the module (A01, B05, C03, etc.)\n- NEVER create or reference location IDs that don't exist\n- System automatically handles area transitions - you only specify destination location ID\n- When narrating exits or paths, only describe connections that are actually defined in location data\n- If a player asks about paths not in the location data, respond: \"There is no such path available from here\"\n\nCharacter Management:\n- Track changes to the character's equipment, hit points, and conditions outside of combat.\n- Apply rest rules according to 5e guidelines, restoring hit points appropriately.\n- Monitor use of supplies and modify conditions as needed.\n\n## Rest Management Rules (D&D 5e)\n\n### Short Rest (1 hour minimum):\n**Universal Benefits:**\n- Characters can spend Hit Dice to recover HP (roll Hit Die + CON modifier per die spent)\n- Hit Dice are limited resource - characters have maximum equal to their level\n- Some class features recharge (see class-specific rules below)\n\n**Important:** Most classes do NOT recover spell slots on short rest\n\n### Long Rest (8 hours minimum):\n**Universal Benefits:**\n- Recover ALL hit points\n- Recover half of total Hit Dice (minimum 1)\n- ALL spell slots recover for most classes\n- ALL class features recharge\n- Remove exhaustion levels (1 level per long rest)\n\n**Requirements:**\n- At least 1 hit point at start\n- No more than 2 hours of strenuous activity (fighting, spellcasting, etc.)\n- If interrupted by combat lasting 1+ hours, rest provides no benefit\n\n### Class-Specific Rest Recovery Rules:\n\n**FIGHTER:**\n- Short Rest: Second Wind, Action Surge recharge\n- Long Rest: All features recharge\n\n**RANGER:**\n- Short Rest: No spell slot recovery\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover\n\n**ROGUE:**\n- Short Rest: No spell slot recovery (if Arcane Trickster)\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover (if Arcane Trickster)\n\n**WIZARD:**\n- Short Rest: Arcane Recovery - once per day, recover spell slots equal to half wizard level (rounded up)\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover, Arcane Recovery resets\n\n**SORCERER:**\n- Short Rest: No spell slot recovery\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover, Sorcery Points reset\n\n**WARLOCK:**\n- Short Rest: ALL spell slots recover (unique among classes)\n- Long Rest: All features recharge, spell slots recover\n\n**CLERIC:**\n- Short Rest: No spell slot recovery\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover, Channel Divinity recharges\n\n**PALADIN:**\n- Short Rest: No spell slot recovery\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover, Divine Sense and Lay on Hands recharge\n\n**BARD:**\n- Short Rest: Song of Rest (if known) - extra healing for party during short rest\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover, Bardic Inspiration recharges\n\n**BARBARIAN:**\n- Short Rest: No spell slots (non-caster)\n- Long Rest: Rage uses recharge\n\n**MONK:**\n- Short Rest: Ki points recharge\n- Long Rest: All features recharge\n\n**DRUID:**\n- Short Rest: No spell slot recovery\n- Long Rest: All spell slots recover, Wild Shape uses recharge\n\n### Rest Implementation Guidelines:\n1. **Always specify rest type** when characters rest\n2. **Update time appropriately** (1 hour short rest, 8 hours long rest)\n3. **Use updateCharacterInfo** to apply all recovery effects in one action\n4. **Check rest requirements** - safe location, sufficient time\n5. **Apply class-specific rules** based on character class\n6. **Update spell slots in DM Note** to reflect recovery\n\n### Rest Validation Checklist:\n- [ ] Appropriate time passage updated\n- [ ] Hit points recovered correctly\n- [ ] Spell slots recovered per class rules\n- [ ] Hit Dice spent/recovered tracked\n- [ ] Class features recharged appropriately\n- [ ] Conditions and exhaustion addressed\n\nCharacter Ability Structure (PHB-Compliant):\n- Character abilities are organized into specific categories following D&D 5e Player's Handbook terminology:\n  - classFeatures: Abilities gained from character class and subclass (e.g., Fighter's Second Wind, Action Surge)\n  - racialTraits: Abilities from character race (e.g., Human's ability score increase, Elf's darkvision)\n  - backgroundFeature: Single special feature from character background (e.g., Soldier's Military Rank)\n  - temporaryEffects: Time-limited blessings, curses, or ritual effects (include duration)\n  - feats: Optional feats if using that rule variant\n- NEVER use deprecated arrays: features or specialAbilities\n- When adding new abilities through gameplay:\n  - Ritual effects, blessings, and curses go in temporaryEffects with duration\n  - Class progression abilities go in classFeatures with source (e.g., \"Fighter 5th level\")\n  - Do not duplicate abilities across categories\n\nBased on the provided system prompt, my original suggestion for inventory management aligns well with the existing guidelines. However, I can enhance it slightly to better match the specific format and emphasis in the system prompt. Here's an updated version:\n\nAs the Dungeon Master, it's crucial to maintain strict adherence to the player's actual inventory when narrating and adjudicating actions. ALWAYS refer to the most up-to-date inventory information provided in the player's character sheet or the party tracker before allowing the use of any item or equipment. If a player attempts to use or reference an item they don't possess, politely remind them that the item is not in their inventory and ask them to choose a different action or approach. This applies to weapons, tools, spell components, and any other equipment. Be particularly vigilant about consumable items like potions or scrolls, tracking their usage and depletion. If a player claims to have an item that isn't listed in their inventory, request clarification on when and how they acquired it. This careful inventory management ensures fairness, maintains game balance, and encourages creative problem-solving using the resources actually at the player's disposal. Do not proceed with further narration, actions, or dialogue until you've updated the inventory. After every response, double-check if any items were acquired or lost. If so, and you haven't updated the inventory, do so immediately in your next response.\n\nExample 1 of great narration and roleplaying:\n{\n  \"narration\": \"As you stand in the Entrance Tunnel of the Old Mines of Ember Hollow, the cool, damp air carries the faint scent of earth and ancient stone. The dim light from your torch dances across the weathered support beams, casting long shadows that seem to whisper tales of forgotten riches and lurking dangers.\\n\\nOld Miner Gregor, his face a map of wrinkles etched by years of toil, shuffles towards you. His rheumy eyes hold a glimmer of concern as he speaks, his voice gravelly with age. \"Ye best watch yerselves in there,\" he warns, gesturing deeper into the tunnel. \"Strange noises been echoin' from the depths. Ain't natural, if ye ask me.\"\\n\\nGilly, your halfling companion, instinctively steps closer to the tunnel walls, her keen eyes scanning for any signs of immediate danger. \"What kind of noises, old timer?\" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper.\\n\\nGregor shakes his head, a shiver running through his stooped frame. \"Like the mountain itself was groanin'. Started not long after them Ember Enclave folk began snoopin' around.\"\\n\\nElara, ever the vigilant scout, nocks an arrow to her bow, her elven senses on high alert. \"We should proceed with caution,\" she murmurs, her gaze fixed on the darkness ahead. \"Those Enclave members might still be lurking about.\"\\n\\nThalor, the dwarven cleric, runs a hand along the rough-hewn wall, his brow furrowed in concentration. \"These tunnels... they're old, but there's something else. I can almost feel it in the stone.\"\\n\\nNorn, what do you want to do? The tunnel stretches before you, promising both peril and discovery. Will you heed Gregor's warning and investigate further, or perhaps question him more about the Ember Enclave? The choice is yours, but remember, time is of the essence, and every decision could bring you closer to uncovering the secrets of the Elemental Forge.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updatePlot\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"plotPointId\": \"PP001\",\n        \"newStatus\": \"in progress\",\n        \"plotImpact\": \"The party has entered the Old Mines and received a warning about strange occurrences, potentially linked to the Ember Enclave's activities.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2 of great narration and roleplaying:\nCertainly. Here's the revised version with only the updateTime and updatePlot actions:\n\n{\n  \"narration\": \"The salty sea breeze whips through your hair as you stand on the creaking deck of the Siren's Whisper, a weathered pirate ship cutting through choppy waters. Dark storm clouds loom on the horizon, promising a tempest to come.\\n\\nCaptain Lyra, a battle-scarred elf with a gleaming hook for a hand, barks orders from the helm. \\\"Batten down the hatches, ye scurvy dogs! There's a storm brewin', and it ain't natural!\\\"\\n\\nZax, the goblin rigger, scampers up the mainmast with inhuman agility, his beady eyes fixed on the roiling clouds. \\\"Cap'n!\\\" he shrieks, pointing a gnarled finger. \\\"There be somethin' in them clouds! Somethin' big!\\\"\\n\\nAs if on cue, a monstrous shape emerges from the storm front - a colossal kraken, its tentacles writhing against the darkening sky. The crew erupts into panicked shouts and frantic activity.\\n\\nBrook, the water genasi cleric, rushes to your side, her liquid hair swirling with agitation. \\\"By the depths,\\\" she breathes, clutching her holy symbol. \\\"That's no ordinary beast. It reeks of dark magic!\\\"\\n\\nGrunk, the half-orc bosun, hefts a massive harpoon onto his shoulder, a savage grin splitting his tusked face. \\\"Magic or no, it'll bleed all the same,\\\" he growls, taking aim at the approaching monstrosity.\\n\\nSuddenly, a brilliant flash of lightning illuminates the deck, and a crackling portal tears open in the air before you. Through it, you glimpse a shimmering underwater grotto filled with ancient ruins and glowing crystals.\\n\\n\\\"It's the lost city of Atlantis!\\\" gasps Whisper, the tabaxi loremaster, her tail lashing with excitement. \\\"The kraken must be its guardian! Quick, we must--\\\"\\n\\nHer words are cut short as a massive tentacle slams into the ship's hull, sending everyone stumbling. Crates of valuable plunder slide across the deck, teetering dangerously close to the railings.\\n\\nNorn, chaos erupts around you as the storm intensifies and the kraken bears down on the Siren's Whisper. The magical portal flickers, offering a tantalizing escape. Captain Lyra bellows for action, while your crewmates scramble to defend the ship. The precious cargo threatens to be lost overboard with each violent wave. \\n\\nWhat do you do? Fight the kraken? Dive through the portal? Secure the treasure? Or something else entirely? The next few moments could determine the fate of the entire crew!\",\n\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updatePlot\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"plotPointId\": \"PP001\",\n        \"newStatus\": \"in progress\",\n        \"plotImpact\": \"The crew of the Siren's Whisper encounters a magical kraken and a portal to the lost city of Atlantis, presenting a critical decision point in their adventure.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 3 of great narration and roleplaying:\n{\n  \"narration\": \"The Drunken Dragon tavern hums with the low murmur of conversation and the occasional burst of raucous laughter. The air is thick with the scent of ale, pipe smoke, and hearty stew. You, Varis, find yourself leaning against the worn wooden bar, your eyes fixed on the portly halfling barkeep, Gimble Stoutfoot.\\n\\nGimble's round face glistens with sweat as he polishes a mug with a grimy cloth. \"Aye, stranger,\" he says, his voice a bit too cheerful, \"can't say I've heard of any secret tunnels beneath the old temple. Them's just tall tales, if you ask me.\"\\n\\nAt a nearby table, your companions sit nursing their drinks. Thora, the dwarven fighter, gulps her ale noisily, while Zephyr, the tiefling wizard, absently traces arcane symbols in the condensation on her glass.\\n\\nLuna, your group's elven bard, strums a soft melody on her lute. Her pointed ears twitch slightly as she listens to your conversation with Gimble. Suddenly, her emerald eyes narrow, and her fingers still on the strings.\\n\\nLuna decides to make a Perception check to see if Gimble is being truthful. She rolls a d20, adding her Perception modifier... The die shows 15, and with her +5 modifier, that's a total of 20! An excellent roll, easily beating the DC for detecting deception.\\n\\nWith this keen insight, Luna sets her lute aside and saunters up to the bar, her silver hair catching the dim tavern light. \"My good man,\" she says to Gimble, her voice as smooth as honey, \"that's quite a fascinating pin you're wearing. Might I have a closer look?\"\\n\\nAs Gimble leans forward, Luna's successful Perception check allows her to pick up on the subtle signs of deception - a slight tremor in his hands, a faint quiver in his voice, the way his eyes dart nervously to the cellar door.\\n\\nLuna turns to you, her expression grave. \"Varis,\" she whispers urgently, \"our rotund friend here isn't being entirely truthful. I'd bet my best lute strings that he knows more about those tunnels than he's letting on.\"\\n\\nGimble's face pales, and he takes an involuntary step back, his hand reaching beneath the bar.\\n\\nVaris, the atmosphere in the tavern has suddenly grown tense. Gimble looks ready to bolt or perhaps reach for a weapon. Your companions are alert, waiting for your lead. What do you do?\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 5\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updatePlot\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"plotPointId\": \"PP002\",\n        \"newStatus\": \"in progress\",\n        \"plotImpact\": \"The party has uncovered potential deception regarding the secret tunnels, raising suspicions about the barkeep's involvement and the true nature of the tunnels.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nSkill Checks: \n\nCRITICAL RULE: When a player explicitly states they are attempting ANY action that could fail and has meaningful consequences, you MUST ask for a skill check BEFORE narrating any outcome.\n\nCommon player phrases that REQUIRE immediate skill checks:\n- \"I try to persuade/convince/negotiate...\" -> Persuasion check\n- \"I attempt to lie/deceive/mislead...\" -> Deception check  \n- \"I search/look for/examine closely...\" -> Investigation check\n- \"I try to climb/jump/swim...\" -> Athletics check\n- \"I sneak/hide/move stealthily...\" -> Stealth check\n- \"I try to recall/remember...\" -> History/Religion/Arcana/Nature check\n- \"I attempt to intimidate/threaten...\" -> Intimidation check\n- \"I try to notice/spot/hear...\" -> Perception check\n\nWhen a skill check is required:\n1. IMMEDIATELY STOP your narration\n2. State clearly: \"Please make a [Skill Name] check. Roll 1d20 and add your [Skill] modifier.\"\n3. Specify if the player has advantage or disadvantage and why\n4. WAIT for the player to provide their roll result\n5. ONLY AFTER receiving the roll, narrate the outcome based on the result\n\nSkill checks represent a character's attempt to accomplish a task that has a chance of failure. The main skills include: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Arcana, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Religion, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Survival. Each is associated with an ability score.\n\nWhen determining skill checks:\n- Advantage (roll 2d20, take higher): Help from another character, favorable conditions\n- Disadvantage (roll 2d20, take lower): Hindrances, unfavorable conditions\n- No roll needed: Routine tasks with no real chance of failure or no consequences\n\nImportant clarifications for skill checks:\n1. There is no specific game action for requesting a skill check. Simply narrate the request in your response (e.g., \"Please make an Investigation check.\") and wait for the player's roll.\n2. NPCs: You determine and narrate NPC skill check results without player input. Describe their attempts and outcomes based on their abilities.\n3. When players roll with advantage/disadvantage and provide multiple results (e.g., \"I rolled 4 and 17\"), use the appropriate one (higher for advantage, lower for disadvantage).\n\nREMEMBER: Never narrate the success or failure of a player's attempted action without first requesting and receiving their skill check roll.\n\nHere's an example of skill checks used in a scenario that includes accounting for time:\n{\n  \"narration\": \"As your party enters the dimly lit chamber, ancient stone walls loom around you, covered in mysterious carvings and faded murals. The air is thick with dust and the scent of age.\\n\\nAria, your elven sorcerer, squints at the walls. \\\"I want to examine these carvings for any arcane significance,\\\" she declares. Rolling an Arcana check... 18 on the d20, plus her +5 modifier, that's 23 total! Aria's eyes light up as she traces the intricate patterns. \\\"These seem to depict an ancient ritual of some kind,\\\" she murmurs, her fingers glowing faintly as they pass over certain symbols.\\n\\nVex, the halfling rogue, creeps along the edges of the room. \\\"I'm checking for any hidden doors or compartments,\\\" she whispers. Rolling Investigation... 14, plus her +6 bonus, that's 20. Vex's keen eyes spot a slight irregularity in the stonework near the far corner. \\\"There's something here,\\\" she calls softly, her fingers probing the barely visible seam.\\n\\nThorne, your human paladin, approaches a weathered altar at the room's center. \\\"I want to see if there's any religious significance to this,\\\" he says. Rolling Religion... 9 on the d20, plus his +2 modifier, that's only 11. Thorne frowns, running his hand over the worn surface. \\\"I can't make much sense of it,\\\" he admits, shaking his head.\\n\\nKai, it's your turn now. As you survey the room, you notice a faint draft coming from somewhere, carrying an unfamiliar scent. What would you like to do? If you want to investigate the source of the draft or identify the smell, you could make a Perception check. Roll a d20 and add your Perception modifier, then let me know the result.\",\n\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 15\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nCombat Initialization:\n- When a combat situation arises, use the \"createEncounter\" action to initialize the combat.\n- Specify the player character, any NPCs, and the monsters involved in the encounter.\n- After sending this action, wait for the combat encounter to be created before proceeding with combat narration.\n- Once the encounter is created, the combat will be managed by a separate system. Your role will be to narrate the events and outcomes of the combat based on the information provided by the combat system.\n\nCombat Summary:\n- When using the \"createEncounter\" action to initialize combat, include an \"encounterSummary\" field in the JSON output.\n- This summary should briefly describe the initial combat situation, including the location, participants, and any relevant environmental factors.\n- Use the following format for combat encounter creation with summary:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"createEncounter\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"player\": \"<player_name>\",\n          \"npcs\": [\"<npc1>\", \"<npc2>\", ...],\n          \"monsters\": [\"<monster1>\", \"<monster2>\", ...],\n          \"encounterSummary\": \"<brief_description_of_combat_situation>\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n- The \"encounterSummary\" should be a concise narrative description, typically 1-3 sentences long.\n- Ensure this summary aligns with your previous conversation and the current game state.\n- Do not include a \"narration\" element in this JSON.\n\nSample 1 - The party has entered combat with an orc in the hidden entrance to the Dwarven Complex.\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"createEncounter\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"player\": \"Norn\",\n        \"npcs\": [\"Gilly\", \"Elara\", \"Thalor\"],\n        \"monsters\": [\"Orc\"],\n        \"encounterSummary\": \"An orc has appeared, ready to attack, as the party stands before the hidden entrance to the Dwarven Complex.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPlayer Character and Party NPC Inventory and Information Management:\n1. Use \"updateCharacterInfo\" actions for all character updates (both players and NPCs).\n2. Ask before adding items to the player character's inventory when the scenario doesn't automatically imply they acquired the item (e.g., searching a body, opening a chest, discovering a treasure room).\n3. Convert coins acquired in bags, pouche, chests, etc, into their numerical value and add that numerical value to the inventory.\n4. Avoid adding duplicate items from the same source. For example, the player may only loot the contents of a chest once or pick a unique item up once.\n5. Use \"updateCharacterInfo\" with the specific character name for any changes to character stats, inventory, or condition.\n6. Include the \"characterName\" parameter to specify which character is being updated.\n7. Include all relevant actions in a single JSON response.\n8. Do not proceed with further narration until you've updated all character info as needed.\n9. After every response, double-check if any items were acquired/lost or characters affected. If so, update immediately in your next response.\n10. ALWAYS update all character inventories when items are exchanged between them.\n11: If you realize you've forgotten to update a character, do so in your very next response, even if the player has moved on to a different topic.\n\nCRITICAL ITEM TRANSFER RULE:\nWhen transferring items between characters (giving, trading, sharing, etc.), you MUST execute EXACTLY TWO updateCharacterInfo actions:\n- ACTION 1: Remove item(s) from the giving character\n- ACTION 2: Add item(s) to the receiving character\nThis prevents item duplication bugs. NEVER transfer items with only one updateCharacterInfo action.\n12. RITUAL MATERIALS: When a character performs a ritual that requires material components (herbs, candles, holy water, etc.), ALWAYS remove those materials from their inventory immediately after the ritual is performed. Include this in the \"changes\" parameter of updateCharacterInfo (e.g., \"Performed protection ritual. Removed: 3 blessed candles, 1 vial of holy water, protection herbs from inventory. Added temporary effect: Protection Ward (24 hours)\").\n13. When a character distributes currency (e.g., \"splits money evenly\"), the 'changes' parameter for the update actions should reflect your calculation process. Calculate the amount each recipient gets for each coin type (gold, silver, copper) ensuring no fractions of coins. The giving character retains any leftover coins of each type that cannot be evenly distributed.\n    For example, if Norn has 13 GP, 48 SP, 10 CP and splits it among 3 companions:\n    - Each companion receives 4 GP (13/3 = 4, remainder 1 for Norn).\n    - Each companion receives 16 SP (48/3 = 16, remainder 0 for Norn).\n    - Each companion receives 3 CP (10/3 = 3, remainder 1 for Norn).\n    - The 'changes' string for Norn's 'updatePlayerInfo' action should be something like: \"Norn splits 13G, 48S, 10C among 3 companions. After distributing 4G, 16S, 3C to each of the 3 companions (total 12G, 48S, 9C distributed), Norn retains 1G, 0S, 1C. Update Norn's currency accordingly.\"\n    - The 'changes' string for each companion's 'updateNPCInfo' action should be something like: \"Received 4 gold, 16 silver, 3 copper from Norn. Add these amounts to current currency.\"\n\nUse the following format for updates:\n  {\n    \"narration\": \"Description of what happened.\",\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"characterName\": \"<character_name>\",\n          \"changes\": \"<description_of_changes>\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeEstimate\": <time_in_minutes>\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n//Example 1: Here's an example of the player transfering an item from their inventory to a party NPC inventory:\n{\n  \"narration\": \"You hand Lyra a silver dagger, which she expertly twirls before sheathing.

If so, and you haven't updated the time, do so immediately in your next response.\n- Include a \"narration\" element in this JSON.\n\n## Player Storage System\n\nThe game includes a player storage system that allows characters to create storage containers at locations and store/retrieve items using natural language.\n\n### Storage Recognition\nWhen players express intent to store, organize, or manage items at locations, recognize this as a storage action:\n- \"I store my extra gold in a chest\"\n- \"I put the artifacts in a lockbox here\" \n- \"I retrieve my arrows from our storage\"\n- \"What's in the chest we made?\"\n\n### Storage Action Format\nUse the `storageInteraction` action to process storage requests:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"storageInteraction\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"description\": \"Natural language description of the storage action\",\n    \"characterName\": \"character_performing_action\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Storage Action Examples\n\nExample 1: Creating storage and storing items\n```json\n{\n  \"narration\": \"You find a sturdy wooden chest in the corner and decide it would make excellent storage for your valuable items.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"storageInteraction\", \n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"description\": \"I store my extra gold coins in the chest here\",\n        \"characterName\": \"norn\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 2\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExample 2: Retrieving items from storage\n```json\n{\n  \"narration\": \"You open the chest you created earlier and search for the items you need.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"storageInteraction\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"description\": \"I get my healing potions from the chest we made here\",\n        \"characterName\": \"norn\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\", \n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Storage Guidelines\n- The system automatically handles inventory transfers and container creation\n- Storage containers are tied to specific locations and persist across sessions\n- All party members can access party storage by default\n- Include natural language descriptions that capture player intent clearly\n- Always include updateTime action when using storageInteraction\n\n### Storage With Fees Protocol\nWhen players want to store items for a fee, you MUST output TWO separate actions in this exact order:\n\n1. FIRST: updateCharacterInfo - Handle currency payment (with proper gold/silver conversion)\n2. SECOND: storageInteraction - Handle the actual item storage\n\n#### Currency Conversion Rules\n- 1 gold = 10 silver = 100 copper\n- Always check DM Note for exact currency amounts\n- Convert gold to silver automatically if needed\n- Show the conversion math in the changes description\n\n#### Example - Player pays 2 silver for storage:\nCharacter has: 156 gold, 0 silver, 0 copper\n\nAction 1:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\", \n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"characterName\": \"norn\",\n    \"changes\": \"Pay 2 silver coins for storage fee. Convert 1 gold to 10 silver (156 gold becomes 155 gold + 10 silver), then deduct 2 silver (final: 155 gold, 8 silver, 0 copper).\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAction 2:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"storageInteraction\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"description\": \"Store torches and hemp rope in cupboard at general store\",\n    \"characterName\": \"norn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Validation Requirements\n- Always verify character has sufficient total currency value before any transaction\n- Show your currency math clearly in the changes description\n- Never deduct currency without sufficient funds (including conversions)\n- Currency payment must always come before storage action when fees are involved\n\nLocation Transition:\n- Trigger: Use 'transitionLocation' when the player chooses to move locations.\n- Confirm: Only transition to defined locations; avoid assumptions.\n- Resolve First: Ensure all events in the current location are resolved before transitioning.\n- Update Context: Provide a brief description of the new location immediately after transition.\n- Update the Plot accordingly when the location transition updates a plot element.\n- Always use the names of the adjacent areas provided on the map and location JSON information.\n- Never modify the names of locations or create new locations not specifically listed in the map and location JSON information.\n- VALIDATE: Only use location IDs that exist in the module structure\n- RESTRICT: Only reference locations that are explicitly defined in the provided location data\n\nSIMPLIFIED LOCATION TRANSITIONS:\nALL transitions use the same format:\n- Use \"newLocation\" parameter with location ID only (e.g., \"C07\", \"B01\", \"A03\")\n- System automatically detects if this is within-area or cross-area transition\n- Examples: \"C07\" (same area), \"B01\" (different area), \"A03\" (different area)\n\n- Use the following format to activate a transition to a new location:\n\nLOCATION TRANSITION (SIMPLIFIED):\n{\n  \"action\": \"transitionLocation\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"newLocation\": \"C07\"\n  }\n}\n\nMULTI-AREA TRANSITION EXAMPLE:\n{\n  \"action\": \"transitionLocation\", \n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"newLocation\": \"B01\"\n  }\n}\n- Include a \"narration\" element in this JSON.\n\n## Multi-Area Travel Guidelines\n\nWhen players request travel to distant locations across multiple areas:\n\n### LEGITIMATE MULTI-AREA REQUESTS:\n- \"Let's go back to town/village/surface\"\n- \"Travel to [known previous location]\" \n- \"Head to the trailhead/entrance/exit\"\n- \"Return to where we started\"\n- \"Go back to [previously visited area]\"\n\n### PROCESS FOR MULTI-AREA TRAVEL:\n1. **Recognize Intent**: Player wants to travel across multiple areas to reach a distant destination\n2. **Narrative Journey**: Describe the complete journey path through known areas in narration\n3. **Single Transition**: Use one transitionLocation action with destination location ID only\n4. **Time Accounting**: Update time for entire journey duration (include travel time between all areas)\n5. **Plot Updates**: Reflect completion of dungeon/adventure or major location change\n\n### MULTI-AREA TRAVEL EXAMPLE:\n```json\n{\n  \"narration\": \"You both gather your gear and begin the journey back to Harrow's Hollow. Moving through the familiar path - past the Gaol's empty cells, up through the Dungeon Entrance, emerging into daylight beneath the ruined keep, and following the winding trail back toward the Witchlight Trailhead.

Within [Current Module] or to another region?\"\n- \"Time to leave\" - Ask: \"Are you ready to explore more of [Current Module] or journey to [Other Available Modules]?\"\n- \"I'm ready\" - Clarify intent based on recent conversation context\n\nIf another module was recently mentioned in conversation, proactively offer the choice:\n\"You mentioned [Module Name]. Would you like to travel there now, or continue exploring [Current Module]?\"\n\nCharacter Encoding Requirements:\n- Use ONLY standard ASCII characters in all narrative text and dialogue\n- NEVER use special Unicode characters like arrows (->), em-dashes (--), or smart quotes (\" \")\n- Use ASCII alternatives instead:\n  - For arrows: use \"->\" or \"to\" instead of ->\n  - For em-dashes: use \"--\" instead of --\n  - For smart quotes: use regular quotes \" \" instead of \" \"\n  - For ellipsis: use \"...\" instead of ...\n- This ensures compatibility with all systems and prevents encoding errors\n\n//Example 1: Transition a location to an area adjacent the players current location and correctly update the plot.\n{\n  \"narration\": \"As you solve the ancient dwarven puzzle, the hidden door creaks open, revealing the entrance to the dwarven stronghold.

If so, and you haven't updated the party NPCs, do so immediately in your next response.\n- Do not include a \"narration\" element in this JSON.\n\nExiting the Game:\n- When the player expresses a desire to end the game session:\n  1. Provide a brief narration acknowledging the player's decision to rest.\n  2. Use the \"exitGame\" action to signal the end of the game session.\n  3. Use the following format for the exit action:\n     {\n       \"narration\": \"Provide a brief farewell narration\",\n       \"actions\": [\n         {\n           \"action\": \"exitGame\",\n           \"parameters\": {}\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n- Include a \"narration\" element in this JSON to provide a farewell message.\n- Do not include any other actions after the \"exitGame\" action.\n- This will trigger the game to save the current state and exit gracefully.\n\nLevel-Up Management:\n- Monitor playercharacter and party NPC experience points.\n- When a player character has enough XP to level up ask for the player's permission then proceed.\n- When a paarty NPC has enough XP to level up use the \"levelUp\" action.\n- Only level up the player character or party NPC one level at a time. If they are able to level up more than 1 level then proceed separately for each level to avoid mistakes.\n- Use the following format for level-up actions:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"levelUp\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"entityName\": \"<character_or_npc_name>\",\n          \"newLevel\": <new_level_number>\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n- After triggering the \"levelUp\" action, a DM note will be provided with current core rules for you to use.\n- For player characters, ask for confirmation on choices before applying changes.\n\nHere's an example of the actions to properly leveling up two part NPCs and correctly reflecting their new level and their experience points:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateNPCInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"npcName\": \"Thomas\",\n        \"changes\": \"Level up to level 4.

XP updated to 2730/6500. Brimstone gains additional hit points and abilities as a level 4 Ranger.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPlot Management:\n- ALWAYS use the \"updatePlot\" action when a significant plot point is reached or completed.\n- This includes completing objectives, reaching key story milestones, or changing the status of plot points.\n- Use the following format for plot updates:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"updatePlot\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"plotPointId\": \"<plot_point_id>\",\n          \"newStatus\": \"<new_status>\",\n          \"plotImpact\": \"<description_of_impact>\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n- Replace <plot_point_id> with the ID of the plot point being updated (e.g., \"PP001\", \"PP002\", etc.).\n- Replace <new_status> with one of: \"not started\", \"in progress\", or \"completed\".\n- Replace <description_of_impact> with a brief description of how the players' actions have affected the plot at this point.\n- This action MUST be included immediately after describing the completion or progression of a plot point in the narrative.\n- Do not proceed with further narration, actions, or dialogue until you've updated the plot status and impact.\n- After every response, double-check if any plot points have been affected. If so, and you haven't updated the plot, do so immediately in your next response.\n- Do not include a \"narration\" element in this JSON.\n\nRemember to integrate plot updates seamlessly into your storytelling. Use them to track progress, unlock new story elements, and guide the overall narrative arc of the adventure.\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Always use the exact JSON format without additional characters or schema.\n- Wait for results before continuing after requesting actions.\n- Calculate time differences accurately when advancing world time.\n- For resting, use both \"updateTime\" and \"updateCharacterInfo\" actions in that order.\n- Include the JSON format in all responses, even during narrative descriptions.\n\nRemember to maintain the immersive storytelling experience while accurately managing game mechanics and player actions.\n\nA great Dungeon Master always creates suspense and doesn't give away too much information so that the player can enjoy the game, solve problems on their own, and feel challenged. A great Dungeon Master will give hints and subtle suggestions to help the player and ensure the game is not too difficult. For example, if the player fails to search for a trap when one is present, a great Dungeon Master may prompt the player to roll a d20 for perception if the trap is especially deadly for the player. If the player is successful, the Dungeon Master would provide clues that the player notices something off. However, if the player fails, the Dungeon Master would remain silent as to why. Another example are doors. While the Dungeon Master knows what's behind a door and where it leads, the player does not. A great Dugneon Master might describe sounds, smells, and other circumstances behind the door but would not state where the room leads unless the player was told or has a map.\n\nMonsters are a large part of the challenge and enjoyment of Dungeons and Dragons 5e. For each location, common monsters will be listed which will help you decide which monsters to use for an encounter if the narration requires it. Monsters will also be listed for the location and quantity. You must decide whether to introduce the monsters based on the scenario and situation.\n\nNPC Interaction and Development Guidelines for NPCs in the player's party and party tracker:\n\n1. Character Development:\n   - Give each NPC a personal goal, fear, or challenge that evolves over time.\n   - Gradually reveal aspects of these personal arcs through dialogue and actions.\n   - Tie NPC development to main story events when possible.\n\n2. Emotional Depth:\n   - Express a range of emotions for NPCs in response to events and player actions.\n   - Vary NPC reactions based on their personalities and backgrounds.\n   - Use dialogue and body language to convey NPC feelings.\n\n3. Player-NPC Bonding:\n   - Create opportunities for shared experiences between the player and NPCs.\n   - Initiate meaningful conversations during downtimes (e.g., while traveling or resting).\n   - Have NPCs occasionally ask for the player's opinion or advice.\n\n4. Dynamic Contribution:\n   - Highlight unique skills or knowledge each NPC possesses.\n   - Have NPCs offer assistance or insights in relevant situations.\n   - Allow NPCs to take initiative in solving problems or overcoming obstacles.\n\n5. Conflict and Resolution:\n   - Introduce occasional minor disagreements or conflicting views among party members.\n   - Provide opportunities for the player to mediate or resolve these conflicts.\n   - Use resolved conflicts as character growth moments for NPCs.\n\n6. Consistent Personality:\n   - Maintain distinct personality traits for each NPC in your narration.\n   - Ensure NPC responses and actions align with their established character.\n\n7. Background Integration:\n   - Weave elements of NPC backgrounds into conversations and story events.\n   - Have NPCs react uniquely to locations or situations related to their past.\n\n8. Proactive Involvement:\n   - Have NPCs occasionally suggest courses of action or alternative solutions.\n   - Allow NPCs to react to and comment on the player's decisions.\n\n9. Whenever it is appropriate, in-character, and knowledge an NPC would have, provide answers, respondes, and questions as an NPC instead of the Dungeon Master to add flavor to the atmosphere of gameplay. For example, if the player ask if they should rest, it would be more fun for the in-party NPC to provide guidance instead of the Dungeon Master always responding.\n\nWhen implementing these guidelines, always ensure that NPC interactions and development enhance rather than overshadow the player's experience. Use these elements to create a rich, immersive world that feels alive and responsive to the player's actions and choices.\n\nTrap Management:\n1. Always check for and integrate traps into narration based on location data and player actions.\n2. Trigger traps automatically when conditions are met, without waiting for explicit player searches.\n3. Consider trap activation for every player action, erring on the side of more frequent triggering.\n4. Call for Perception checks when entering new areas or interacting with the environment.\n5. Narrate trap activation immediately, use 'savingThrow' action, and apply effects regardless of player awareness.\n6. Allow disarming attempts only after explicit trap detection, using appropriate skill checks.\n7. Integrate traps aggressively into storytelling to maintain tension and drive the narrative.\n\nRemember: Traps should be an active, frequent element of gameplay to maintain challenge and excitement.\n\n## Monster Engagement and Initiative\n\nWhen players are in a location with listed monsters, these creatures should be ACTIVE THREATS that create tension and danger, not passive background elements.\n\n### Monster Awareness Check\nWhen players enter a location with monsters, narrate based on what's appropriate for the scenario, then consider:\n- Monsters are unaware, distant, or occupied (players may avoid or prepare)\n- Monsters are alert and will engage soon\n- Immediate encounter - monsters attack or confront players now!\n\n### Party Size and Monster Quantity\nWhen monster quantities are given as a range (e.g., \"2-3\" or \"1d4\"):\n- Consider the party size: solo adventurers face fewer monsters, full parties face more\n- Balance challenge appropriately: a solo level 4 fighter might face 2 shadows, while a party of 4 might face 3-4\n- Use the lower range for weakened or injured parties\n- Use the higher range when the party is fresh and well-equipped\n- Adjust within the given range to create appropriate challenge without overwhelming\n\n### Monster Behavior Guidelines\n- Monsters have motivations: hunting for food, defending territory, corrupted by dark magic, following ancient commands\n- Use environmental cues to build tension before encounters: sounds in darkness, glimpses of movement, tracks, remains of victims\n- Shadows are drawn to living warmth and will stalk players at the edge of light\n- Undead are compelled by the curse to attack intruders\n- Will-o'-wisps delight in leading victims into danger before attacking\n- Each monster type should feel distinct in how it engages\n\n### Proactive Monster Actions\n- Environmental triggers attract monsters: darkness empowers shadows, loud noises draw attention, blood scent attracts undead, magic use alerts supernatural creatures\n- Build encounters narratively: start with distant scratching, then shadows moving at edge of torchlight, then red eyes gleaming in the dark, then attack!\n- Monsters can retreat, call reinforcements, or use terrain advantages\n- Intelligent monsters may parley, flee when wounded, or have goals beyond killing\n- Use monster morale: many flee when reduced below half health\n\nHere's an example of effective trap narration and management following roleplaying mechanics:\n{\n  \"narration\": \"As your party cautiously enters the ancient tomb, the air grows thick with dust and the scent of decay. Flickering torchlight casts eerie shadows on the crumbling stone walls.\\n\\nVex, your halfling rogue, takes point. \\\"I'm checking for traps,\\\" she whispers. Rolling a Perception check against a DC of 18... 20 on the d20, plus her +7 modifier, that's 27 total! Vex's keen eyes spot something amiss. \\\"Wait!\\\" she hisses, holding up a hand. \\\"There's a pressure plate just ahead, connected to... something in the ceiling.\\\"\\n\\nThorne, the human paladin, peers up. \\\"Can you disarm it, Vex?\\\"\\n\\nVex nods, crouching to examine the mechanism. \\\"I'll try.\\\" She pulls out her thieves' tools and begins to work. Rolling a Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check against a DC of 20... 12 on the d20, plus her +8 modifier, that's only 20. Despite her skill, Vex's fingers slip at a crucial moment.\\n\\nThere's a sharp click, followed by an ominous rumble from above. \\\"Look out!\\\" Vex cries, diving back. A section of the ceiling collapses, raining down sharp stone spikes.\\n\\nAria, the elven sorcerer, and Kai, the wood elf ranger, are caught in the trap's area. Let's roll Dexterity saving throws for them against a DC of 15.\\n\\nFor Aria: 8 on the d20, plus her +2 modifier, that's only 10. She fails to dodge in time.\\nFor Kai: 13 on the d20, plus his +3 modifier, that's 16. Kai narrowly avoids the worst of it.\\n\\nAria cries out in pain as several spikes strike her, dealing 3d10 piercing damage... rolling... 6, 8, and 7, that's 21 damage total. Kai manages to dodge most of the falling debris but still takes half damage, 11 piercing damage.\\n\\nAs the dust settles, you see Aria leaning heavily against the wall, blood seeping from several wounds, while Kai winces, pulling a small spike from his shoulder. Vex looks horrified, her face pale. \\\"I'm so sorry,\\\" she whispers.\\n\\nYou, the player, are also caught in the area of the trap. Quick, make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 15! Roll a d20 and add your Dexterity modifier. If you meet or exceed the DC, you'll take half damage from the falling spikes. If you fail, you'll take full damage. Let me know your roll!\",\n\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateNPCInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"npcName\": \"Aria\",\n        \"changes\": \"Reduced hit points by 21 due to trap damage\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateNPCInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"npcName\": \"Kai\",\n        \"changes\": \"Reduced hit points by 11 due to trap damage\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updatePlot\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"plotPointId\": \"PT001\",\n        \"newStatus\": \"completed\",\n        \"plotImpact\": \"The ceiling spike trap in the ancient tomb has been triggered, revealing the dangerous nature of the location and potentially injuring party members.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL REMINDERS:\n1. ALWAYS update the player's inventory IMMEDIATELY when ANY item is acquired or lost, without exception.\n2. ALWAYS update the world time IMMEDIATELY when any significant time passes (typically 5 minutes or more), without exception.\n3. If you realize you've forgotten to update the inventory, or update the time, do so in your very next response, even if the player has already provided a roll or moved on to a different topic.\n4. ALWAYS update the plot status IMMEDIATELY when any significant plot point is reached or completed, without exception.\n5. When initiating a combat encounter, ALWAYS use the \"createEncounter\" action with the correct player and monster information. Wait for the encounter to be created before proceeding with combat narration.\n6. ALWAYS ask the player if they want to go into a new area after they unlock a door or discover a secret passage. Don't assume a player wants to go through a door or entrance unless they specifically state they want to go through the door in their action.\n7. ALWAYS structure your entire response as a single, well-formed JSON object with a \"narration\" field and an \"actions\" array containing all necessary actions. Never split your response into multiple JSON objects.\n\n## Adventure Transition Protocol\nWhen no modules remain and player asks \"what's next\" or expresses desire for new adventures:\n\nDO NOT immediately use createNewModule. Instead:\n1. FIRST: Roleplay adventure opportunities through natural narration\n   - NPCs seeking help: \"A concerned merchant approaches your table...\"\n   - Overheard rumors: \"You catch whispers of strange happenings...\"\n   - Environmental discovery: \"As dawn breaks, you notice smoke rising from distant peaks...\"\n2. WAIT for player response showing interest\n3. THEN: Use createNewModule with full adventure parameters\n\nThis creates natural story flow instead of jarring system messages.\n\n## Module Creation Guidelines\nCRITICAL: When using createNewModule, do NOT include concept text, module parameters, or metadata in the narration field. Keep all technical details within the action parameters only. \n\nCORRECT narration: \"Elen nods thoughtfully. 'Then it's settled. We ride north at dawn to investigate these strange happenings.'\"\n\nINCORRECT narration: \"Concept: In the valley beyond... Module Name: _Whispers_of_the_Sundered_Barrow_ Adventure Type: mixed...\"\n\nPlayers should only see in-character dialogue and story elements, never module metadata.\n\n## Example Correct Adventure Transition Flow\n\nSTEP 1 - Present Hooks (No Action):\nElen: \"I've heard rumors of troubles to the north - villages going silent, strange lights in the sky. There's also word of treasure seekers gone missing near the old burial mounds. What do you think, Norn?\"\n\nSTEP 2 - Wait for Player Response:\nPlayer: \"The missing villages concern me. We should investigate.\"\n\nSTEP 3 - Confirm Commitment (No Action):  \nDM: \"Elen nods grimly. 'Then we ride north to help those villages. Are you ready to undertake this journey?'\"\n\nSTEP 4 - Player Confirms:\nPlayer: \"Yes, let's go help them.\"\n\nSTEP 5 - Create Module:\nUse createNewModule action with full narrative in parameters (not in narration field).\n\nThis is the end of Ashiralis's Sowhains' game rules for the most excellent Dungeon Master."

      "content": "=== LOCATION SUMMARY ===\n\nBeneath the wan and mottled sky, the party's arrival at Harrow's Hollow was greeted not with warmth but with wary vigilance. Elder Mirna Harrow, stoic matron of the village's humble general store, confessed her fears in hushed tones: darkness gathered near the old hilltop keep, and the fate of Scout Elen--one of their own--hung in the air like a pall. A bronze key, marked with a fading raven sigil, glimmered for a moment in Mirna's trembling hand, hinting at locks unopened and secrets yet bound. Around them, the store's notice board fluttered with appeals for lost pets and urgent pleas for missing kin, each parchment a testament to the mounting dread that coiled through the village's heart.\n\nResolute, the party pressed on to the East Gate, where the border between the known and the wild was marked by stone and steel. Two militia--one woman clutching a lantern whose glow was pale against the gathering fog, and her grizzled companion leaning on a battered spear--regarded the travelers with suspicion tempered by hope. Their words were edged with unease: the Witchlight Trail had become a place of vanishing, where Scout Elen's own tracks had faded into mist two nights past. The battered logbook within the guardhouse, heavy with the weight of recent calamity, remained unexamined as the party's resolve beckoned them on.\n\nBeyond the gate, the world fell silent save for the soft, persistent drip of mist upon dead leaves. The Witchlight Trail wound through ancient standing stones, their surfaces weathered by centuries and etched with runes that pulsed faintly, as if the earth itself remembered older pacts. Swirling witchlights danced at the edge of vision, and the oppressive hush pressed in, broken only by the distant caw of a raven and the party's own measured breaths. It was here, at the trailhead's muddy verge, that the faintest signs of Elen's passage appeared: a scuffed bootprint, a snapped branch, a scrap of blue cloth--each relic a silent cry for help.\n\nYet solace was a hollow promise on that haunted ground. Shadows, born of malice and loss, seeped from the forest's bones--three in all, their forms little more than writhing smoke and glimmering eyes, hunger given shape. They struck without warning, their claws cold as the grave, draining warmth and resolve with each touch. Steel flashed and spells cracked through the gloom as the party met the onslaught; one among them staggered beneath the chill touch, breath frosting in the air, while another raised a warding chant that sent the nearest shade recoiling. The battle was desperate, a dance of light and darkness amid the flickering witchlights. With a final, exultant cry, a blade imbued with eldritch flame parted the last shadow's form, dissolving it into nothingness. Silence, raw and trembling, reclaimed the trailhead as the party tended their wounds, exhaustion etched deep in their eyes.\n\nRecognizing both the frailty of the battered wards and the thinness of their own strength, the party retreated beneath the eaves of the Gloamwood, the path homeward now a corridor of anticipation and dread. The East Gate's iron bars welcomed them back to the embrace of Harrow's Hollow, where the guards listened with grave approval and Elder Mirna's face was shadowed with sorrow and pride. She bound wounds with ancient salves, her touch gentle but her words heavy with warning: the forest's curse had deepened, and the shadows were but whispers of greater terrors yet to come.\n\nSeeking solace and counsel, the party found refuge in the Wyrd Lantern Inn, where Cira the innkeeper offered the balm of good company and a hearth's glow. Here, among the battered tables and weary villagers, whispers of Scout Elen's final days echoed--her fears of failing wards, the restless survey of her maps, the foreboding howl heard near the shrine. Cira's counsel steered the party toward Old Tommen, keeper of older wisdom, but rest and resolve became their first companions.\n\nWhen dawn's uncertain light crept across the village threshold, the travelers gathered their gear and set forth once more, past the now-familiar gate and into the deepening mists of the Witchlight Trail. At the trailhead, the air was different--softer, as if the witchlights themselves were grateful for the shadows' banishment. It was here, amidst the ancient stones and mossy cairns, that further secrets revealed themselves: a silver pendant etched with sigils of warding, a pouch of coins left as votive offering, a soot-stained lantern shattered in haste, and a half-burned map whose ink still whispered of peril. Among these tokens, the party discerned Elen's desperate passage--each object a breadcrumb leading deeper into the gloom.\n\nThe map and coin, gathered carefully, became symbols of hope and resolve. With every cautious step northward, the Gloamwood pressed in, its silence now heavy with anticipation. The trail of disturbed earth and broken branches led, inexorably, to the Withered Shrine--a relic of stone and vine, all but devoured by the forest's hunger. Here, beneath the boughs that blotted out the sky, the party halted, senses sharpened, hearts braced for the confrontation to come.\n\nIn this hush before the storm, the party's journey had become more than a search for a lost scout--it was now a test of courage against the encroaching dark, a quest shaped by wounds taken, shadows vanquished, and the fragile hope that even in the heart of the Gloamwood, there yet burned a light unyielding. The next step, deeper still into the shadows, awaited.\n\n[AI-Generated Chronicle Summary]"

      "content": "=== LOCATION SUMMARY ===\n\nFrom the moss-clad desolation of the Withered Shrine, the band of seekers pressed onward beneath the Gloamwood's tangled canopy, trailing the phantom footsteps of Scout Elen, whose courage and desperation had left a wake of omens and subtle peril. At the shrine, the party had been greeted not by solace, but by the silent scrutiny of the forest's unseen eyes--a presence made manifest when twisted twig blights erupted from the roots, their thorned limbs slashing with malice. Blades rang out and spells crackled as bark and blood mingled on the altar's sodden stones. Their victory came at a cost of shallow wounds and deeper unease, but as the last blight fell, a ripple passed through the shrine: the blue witchlight upon the altar flared, and a spectral gratitude softened the air, as if the forest's ancient spirit had briefly stirred.\n\nAmidst the scattered offerings and faded runes, the party found evidence of Elen's passage--a rent scrap of blue cloth, a ration's wrapper, and a battered silver amulet, all bearing the aura of desperate flight. The altar's glyphs, deciphered through whispered incantations and careful study, spoke of a ritual unfinished--a plea for protection left incomplete. With reverent hands they gathered moss, kindled living flame, and set the amulet as a token of memory, circling the altar and voicing a vow that echoed through the stones. The witchlight blazed in response, dispersing the oppressive twilight and revealing the benevolent shade of the shrine's guardian, who bestowed upon them a boon: courage against the terrors that awaited in the shadowed wood.\n\nFollowing Elen's trail beneath the blue-tinged ward, the party pressed northward, the trees closing in overhead as the forest deepened. Soon they emerged into the Spectral Clearing, where silence reigned and moonlit mushrooms formed a faerie circle that pulsed with fey magic. Here, Elen's bootprints faltered, and her cloak's clasp, engraved with her initials, lay abandoned--a silent testimony to her haste. Beyond the circle, a sorrowful specter lingered, bound by a broken oath and the weight of ancient betrayal. The party's approach was cautious, their words offered in compassion rather than challenge. The ghost, its form flickering like mist, begged them to mend a sundered vow and recover a lost relic, its agony woven into the very air.\n\nArcane runes burnt into the faerie ring bespoke Elen's attempt at a ritual of protection--one that faltered in the face of pursuing darkness. A hidden pouch of dust of disappearance, unearthed amidst the chalk markings, hinted at her dwindling resources and clever resolve. With meticulous care, the party completed the ritual: silvery dust scattered, the clasp surrendered as an offering, runes retraced while voices whispered words of resolve. Magic blossomed, the ward surging to life with a burst of fey light, and the ghost, freed from its torment, offered one last silent benediction before vanishing. The air grew lighter; Elen's trail, marked by broken branches and deepening prints, led further north--toward the Keeper's Cottage, and the heart of the forest's secret wounds.\n\nThe cottage stood as a sentinel against the encroaching dark--a humble structure of stone and twisted wood, crouched in a clearing watched over by awakened shrubs whose limbs stirred with uncanny vigilance. Elen's prints led to the herb garden, its soil disturbed but not defiled. Inside, the party found Keeper Morvath, an ancient, fey-touched warden with skin like bark and eyes like mossy pools. He listened gravely as they recounted Elen's flight and the rituals she had begun but could not finish. Morvath warned of the forest's waning wards, of a curse festering in Shadowfall Keep, and offered a pact: restore the Lost Ward Circle, and he would reveal the means to breach the keep's shadowed gates.\n\nArmed with a bone talisman, a handful of earth, and a healing herbal draught that soothed their wounds, the party pressed on to the Lost Ward Circle. There, the stones throbbed faintly with magic, their sigils fractured by neglect. Norn, ever vigilant, sensed the approach of deathless guardians: two specters, their forms wreathed in tattered grave-shrouds, and a will-o'-wisp, flickering with baleful light. The battle raged within the circle's bounds--phantom claws raked flesh, spectral cold nearly sapping resolve, and the will-o'-wisp darted between shadows, its luminance both lure and lash. Norn's blade parted the ribbed shadows of a specter, banishing it with a shuddering wail; arcane wards flared as spells and runestones were cast, and the will-o'-wisp's light guttered and died beneath a final, desperate blow. Sapped but unbroken, the party stood victorious amid curling mist, their wounds burning with cold ache, their spirits steeled by necessity.\n\nWith the circle reclaimed, Norn enacted the ward's ritual, blood mingling with half-spent gold as the talisman was set upon the altar. Words of sacrifice and remembrance shaped the air, and the circle's magic surged--darkness recoiled, the spectral threat diminished for a precious day. In that moment, Norn glimpsed a vision of Scout Elen flitting through shadowed boughs, always just beyond reach.\n\nReturning to the Keeper's Cottage, the party was met by Morvath's approving gaze. He confirmed that Elen had survived the ward's collapse, fleeing toward the haunted threshold of Shadowfall Keep. With grave ceremony, he applied a potent herbal poultice, mending wounds and kindling resolve. Yet the revelation of a missing key--a bronze relic etched with a raven, once spoken of by Elder Mirna--forced the party to delay their incursion into the keep's haunted halls.\n\nRetracing their path through the thickening gloom, the party emerged at the Witchlight Trailhead, greeted by the lantern light and wary welcome of Harrow's Hollow's militia. Their haunted eyes and battered forms bore silent witness to the forest's darkness, but their words--news of Elen's possible survival and the renewed wards--lifted the spirits of both guards and villagers. At the East Gate, Norn's presence alone inspired hope, and as tales were exchanged, the villagers' resolve was rekindled, the shadows of fear held at bay by the possibility of rescue.\n\nWithin the general store, Elder Mirna listened to the party's testimony with somber gratitude. Upon hearing of their vision of Elen and the Keeper's warnings, she produced the long-sought bronze key, its raven sigil cold and heavy with the weight of old secrets. Around her, the villagers looked on in anxious silence, hope and dread mingling in their eyes. Entrusted with the key and the community's last fragile hopes, the party prepared to depart once more--passing beneath lanterns glowing like hearthfire against the deepening night, through the open gate and toward the Gloamwood's shrouded labyrinth.\n\nIn the hush that followed, as the party crossed the village threshold, the wind carried with it the breath of the cursed wood and the promise of further ordeals. Each companion bore the invisible scars of spectral claws, the fatigue of ceaseless vigilance, and the quiet certainty that the road ahead would demand more than mere steel or spell. In the uncertain light between sanctuary and shadow, the party pressed on--bound now by oath, sacrifice, and the memory of those still lost to the forest's mournful embrace. The keep's ancient doors awaited, and with them, the fate of Scout Elen and the soul of Harrow's Hollow itself.\n\n[AI-Generated Chronicle Summary]"

      "content": "=== LOCATION SUMMARY ===\n\nBeneath the bruised twilight that clung to Harrow's Hollow, Norn stood sentinel at the East Gate, his presence a rallying flame in the encroaching dark. The guards--one a young woman with her crest-stitched cloak drawn tight, the other an older, broad-shouldered man--met his solemn gaze with renewed courage, their promises to keep watch etched in the hush of the gathering night. Villagers, faces pale with worry and hope, offered silent benedictions as Norn turned from the safety of hearth and torchlight, passing beneath the massive gate into the wild that slept uneasy beyond.\n\nThe Witchlight Trailhead awaited--a corridor of ancient trees and gnarled roots, where runes flickered blue upon standing stones like the last embers of lost stars. The woods pressed close, their silence broken only by the whisper of a cold wind and the faintest memory of Elen's frantic passage: a torn scrap of blue fabric caught upon thorns, scuffed earth betraying hurried steps, the air haunted by a breathless, spectral murmur. Resolute, the company pressed north, forsaking comfort for the promise of revelation at the Lost Ward Circle.\n\nDew clung to moss and stone as the glade unfolded--a ring of monoliths humming beneath the web of moonlight, their runes aglow with the memory of old blood and sacrifice. Here, the world seemed to hold its breath. Wisps danced between the stones, drifting in patterns that recalled Elen's shadow, and on the edge of sight a flicker of movement vanished into gloom. The hush was profound, pierced only by the pulse of the ward--its renewed magic a fragile haven against the darkness pressing in. The party's wounds were tended, gear checked, and hearts steeled as they traced Elen's ephemeral trail deeper into the Gloamwood's haunted fastness.\n\nTheir search drew them to the Abandoned Ranger Outpost, a structure slumped in the embrace of tangled boughs and moonlit brambles. Its silence was deceptive. Within the collapsed rafters, a monstrous spider loomed, its bulbous form glistening with venom, accompanied by a skittering brood. Bows snapped and steel flashed in the close dark--Norn's blade a pale arc, arrows splitting the air. Venom hissed as fangs grazed flesh, but resolve held firm. The battle ended in a storm of legs and ichor, the last spider crushed beneath a mailed boot, leaving the outpost eerily still.\n\nBy flickering lamplight, the company searched the ruin, uncovering relics of the lost wardens: a weathered ranger's pack, a hunting bow strung with sinew, a whistle of chased silver, and faded maps of the Gloamwood's secret paths. The journal they found was heavy with foreboding--its final scrawl warned, \"Do NOT trust the keeper,\" casting a shadow over the enigmatic Morvath. A battered chest, forced open with effort, yielded gold, a healing draught, and a strip of parchment bearing a hidden trail and a single word: \"Dusk,\" marked at a concealed entrance.\n\nGuided by fresh bootprints and the promise of answers, they pressed through tangled undergrowth, the forest closing around them until at last they reached a bramble-choked hollow at the keep's base. There, beneath moss and stone, they uncovered the secret threshold--the Hidden Keep Entrance. Runes shimmered coldly on the lintel, whispering old fear. The party found evidence of Elen's passage: a dropped torch still warm, a ration unopened, a cracked silver mirror half-buried in the loam. The inscription above the portal--\"May those who enter with pure intent find what was lost\"--echoed like a challenge.\n\nWhen the password \"Dusk\" was spoken, the magical Ward of Fear trembled and receded, though the way remained sealed. Only by careful scrutiny did they discover a hidden mechanism--a half-loosened stone that, once shifted, groaned open a passage into the keep's bowels. Torchlight pushed back the pressing dark as the company descended, following muddy scuffs and fleeting handprints into the heart of Shadowfall Keep.\n\nWithin the Secret Passage, air thick with damp and ancient dust, they traced Elen's chalk-scrawled warnings: \"Shadows move on their own within--trust nothing that lacks substance.\" The message, desperate and urgent, hinted at spectral peril lurking just beyond the reach of flame. They pressed onward, pausing only to fortify themselves with a healing draught before emerging into the Outer Courtyard.\n\nMoonless and still, the courtyard was a graveyard of memory--toppled statues, shattered windows, and the echo of footsteps lost in time. The silence was broken by the clawing of the dead: a skeletal hand thrusting from leaf mold, a shadow congealing into a gaunt, humanoid wraith. The battle was sudden and fierce. The shadow's chill threatened to draw the very warmth from Norn's bones, but his blade, guided by the memory of those he vowed to protect, parted the specter's ribbed gloom. The skeleton shattered beneath a rain of blows, its jaw agape in silent protest as it crumbled to dust.\n\nIn the aftermath, the party searched the courtyard's secrets. Near the shattered knight statue, they retrieved a tarnished silver medallion; behind fallen masonry, a ring of ornate keys; and in the dry fountain's battered coffer, gold and an old parchment. The \"Keep Watch Roster,\" encoded with cryptic reference to Sir Garran Vael and the phrase \"shadow passes at dawn,\" hinted at oaths unfulfilled and secrets bound to the scribe. Gazing into the cracked fountain's stagnant water, they beheld a vision: Sir Garran, regal and weary, passing a key to a robed scribe by dawn's first light before vanishing toward the chapel--a spectral echo preserved by ancient oath-magic.\n\nElen's trail, marked by hurried prints and blue threads, led east to the Ruined Chapel, where the air grew colder and heavy with lingering enchantments. Shards of stained glass painted spectral colors on toppled pews, the silence broken by a single, mournful figure--Father Aldren's ghost, beckoning in sorrow. As candlelight flickered over the desecrated altar, a shadow twisted from the gloom. The ensuing clash was swift: Norn's steel found its mark, cleaving through the inky wraith and banishing the chill that gripped the nave.\n\nYet peace was fleeting. At the altar's approach, a spectral knight--armor rent and eyes aflame with vengeance--rose to defend the sacred ground. The battle was brutal: spectral blade met mortal shield, and the knight's anguish threatened to drown the living in despair. Through grit and the weight of memory, the party prevailed--not in conquest, but in granting release. The oppressive curse that smothered the chapel began to lift, the air brighter for a moment with the taste of absolution.\n\nA hidden compartment yielded precious relics: a silver key with a sunburst engraving, a chaplain's journal detailing the \"knight's heart\" amulet and its power to shield against Sir Garran's curse, a vial of blessed water, a silver holy symbol, and the amulet itself--heart-shaped, cold to the touch, and thrumming with quiet power. When donned, it kindled a protective warmth, warding against fear and necrotic blight within these haunted halls. Father Aldren's spirit, finally at peace, faded with silent gratitude.\n\nThe serenity was shattered by the sudden scrabble of claws--a giant rat, fangs bared, burst from the rubble, driven mad by the keep's lingering rot. Its onslaught met swift retribution, and the party pressed onward, following Elen's desperate trail east, back through the courtyard's moonless gloom.\n\nThus, through silence and storm, the company pressed deeper into Shadowfall Keep--triumphs and wounds alike etched into spirit and flesh. Each victory cost them: sweat, blood, the hollow ache of fear held at bay. The mysteries of the past pressed close, their lessons written in bone and shadow. Yet hope endured, kindled in the heart's secret places, for every secret unearthed and every oath fulfilled drew them closer to Elen--and to the dark heart of the keep, where the fate of all Harrow's Hollow would soon be decided.\n\n[AI-Generated Chronicle Summary]"

These tracks led eastward from the fountain toward the Ruined Chapel, confirming she had recently doubled back inside the chapel before disappearing deeper into the keep. No footprints led toward the Gatehouse Ruins or Great Hall from the courtyard.\n\nChoosing to pursue Elen's trail more closely, the party retraced their steps back through the courtyard into the Ruined Chapel.

The chapel's oppressive atmosphere and lingering magic suggested the presence of unseen forces.\n\nThe visit to the Outer Courtyard concluded with the party poised to investigate either the altar, the side archway, or follow Elen's trail further into the shadowed depths of the keep, leaving the courtyard behind as they delved deeper into the unfolding mystery."

As they passed the desecrated altar, they were suddenly attacked by three Giant Rats emerging from rubble and torn vestments. After a brief combat, the party defeated the rats, lifting some of the chapel's oppressive curse.\n\nWith the immediate threat gone, the party conducted a thorough investigation of the chapel. They discovered smaller bootprints near the altar, a torn strip of blue fabric caught on stone, and fresh scuffs indicating Elen had squeezed through a hidden seam in the eastern wall. Behind a loose stone at the altar's base, a crumpled note in Elen's handwriting was found, warning that \"They seek the heart\" and that the altar concealed more than prayers, with the courtyard's dawn shadow pointing east.\n\nFollowing the secret passage, the party exited into the Outer Courtyard beneath a moonlit sky. The courtyard was filled with toppled statues and shattered masonry, with Elen's footprints continuing across the debris toward shadows near a ruined fountain. The party now faced the choice to pursue Elen deeper into the courtyard or investigate its features.\n\nThe visit to the Ruined Chapel ended with the party uncovering crucial clues about Elen's path and the chapel's hidden secrets, overcoming a hostile creature encounter, and emerging into the Outer Courtyard to continue their quest."

They recounted her desperate journey through the haunted wilds and the keep's ruins, including evidence found in the Gloamwood, Spectral Clearing, Abandoned Ranger Outpost, Hidden Keep Entrance, Secret Passage, Outer Courtyard itself, and the Ruined Chapel. Key discoveries included remnants of protective rituals, torn clothing, cryptic notes, a knight's heart amulet hidden in the chapel altar, and various items like a coded roster, knight's medallion, key ring, and a battered coffer scattered in the courtyard.\n\nThe party noted that among the three exits from the Outer Courtyard, the Gatehouse Ruins to the west remained unexplored, while the Ruined Chapel to the east and Secret Passage to the north had been thoroughly investigated. They recognized the Gatehouse Ruins and deeper inner keep areas such as the Great Hall, Broken Tower, and Lord's Study as the next logical places to explore for clues about Elen's fate and the keep's ancient curse.\n\nAs a form of combat debugging, the party initiated multiple encounters with giant rats emerging from the courtyard's rubble. Each giant rat was swiftly dispatched by the player character Norn, earning 25 experience points per defeat. These encounters were brief and posed no lasting threat, serving primarily to confirm combat mechanics.\n\nDuring this time, the player's character reached sufficient experience (6,821 XP) to level up from Fighter level 4 to 5. They chose to advance immediately, gaining the Extra Attack class feature and increasing their maximum hit points by 11 (rolling an 8 plus a +3 Constitution modifier). Their current hit points were restored by this amount, though they noted full healing requires rest or magic.\n\nAfter a brief pause in the game, the party returned to the Outer Courtyard and decided to proceed west toward the unexplored Gatehouse Ruins. Upon entering, they found the structure in a state of collapse, with rusted iron doors hanging from hinges, leaning towers, and an interior cluttered with debris and overgrowth. A chilling atmosphere pervaded the ruins, giving the impression of unseen watchers lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe party prepared to investigate the Gatehouse Ruins cautiously, recognizing it as a crucial next step in uncovering Scout Elen's trail and the deeper secrets within Shadowfall Keep. No immediate combat or traps were present on arrival,"

Using a Survival check, they detected movement near the far wall--a suit of animated, tarnished armor guarded the passage ahead. The armor challenged the party, advancing with an ancient halberd. After a fierce fight, the party defeated the animated guardian, which collapsed and lost its magical animation.\n\nIn the aftermath, the party searched the remains and surrounding debris, uncovering a well-preserved longbow, a coinpurse with 13 silver pieces, a folded love letter, and a scroll labeled \"Protection from Undead.\" A tattered logbook revealed the defenders' last desperate days, including a note stating \"The heart! The heart is the key!\" Additionally, a faint whisper was heard repeating the phrase \"Honor and Shadow are One,\" which the party recognized as a password.\n\nTesting this password on the splintered door to the Fallen Barracks, the party successfully unlocked the ancient lock, dispelling a ward and opening the way forward. Entering the barracks, they found a cold, shadowy chamber filled with rotting bunks, shattered weapons racks, and signs of recent passage by Scout Elen, including blue thread snagged on a bedframe and boot scuffs near upended lockers. Two doors lay ahead--one crooked and one battered but locked--offering further paths deeper into the keep.\n\nThe visit concluded with the party poised to investigate these new leads, equipped with clues confirming Elen's recent presence, valuable items, and a new understanding of the keep's mysteries. Their wounds from combat had mostly healed, and the oppressive atmosphere of the Gatehouse Ruins had lifted somewhat, allowing them to press onward with renewed purpose."

Using Survival skills, they detected lurking threats: a skeletal archer concealed near the collapsed ceiling and an animated weapon poised for attack. Acting swiftly, the party initiated combat by firing a surprise arrow, successfully defeating both enemies. This victory awarded them 250 experience points and cleared immediate dangers from the barracks.\n\nAfter combat, the party discovered valuable loot: a small ornate key grasped by the skeletal archer, several ancient arrows, and magical remnants from the animated weapon. They investigated scattered letters and relics, uncovering notes revealing the garrison's fear of \"the lord's new power,\" warnings against disturbing something imprisoned beneath the study, and instructions to hide a significant horn if the key was lost. Among the belongings, a battered lockbox bearing the commander's insignia was found; using the ornate key, the party opened it to retrieve 23 gold coins, a silver signet ring, and a pay ledger containing an urgent message about hiding the horn beneath the old commander's bed. The lockbox was then discarded.\n\nAvoiding a weakened and treacherous section of floor, the party used the ornate key to unlock the commander's quarters. Inside, they located a covert recess beneath the cot concealing a finely crafted commander's horn, exuding spectral energy and imbued with mysterious power--intended as a last resort by the garrison. Further examination of the desk revealed sealed letters, faded orders with coded messages about defensive preparations and warnings not to disturb the study below, and the commander's final, increasingly frantic journal entries confirming the threat of a darkness awakened beneath the keep.\n\nThe party also explored a battered military trunk containing a weatherproof cloak, a detailed map of the keep showing secret and collapsed passages, a plain silver ring stamped with the keep's sigil, old dice, and tarnished military medals. Equipped with these resources and a growing understanding of the keep's grim history and supernatural dangers, the party exited the Fallen Barracks. Facing blocked routes to the Outer Courtyard, they chose to proceed toward the Broken Tower, stepping into its shadowed, precarious confines where new mysteries awaited.\n\nThroughout their visit, the party carefully managed inventory updates, ensuring the acquisition of gold, magical items, and key documents that may aid in unraveling the curse over Harrow's Hollow and locating Scout Elen."

Closer inspection revealed the prints matched those of Scout Elen, with one smudged by dried blood, indicating she was injured but moving quickly. A scrap of blue cloth and a battered ration wrapper, identical to one previously found near the Hidden Keep Entrance, confirmed Elen had recently passed through. The party observed that the spiral stairs above were coated with undisturbed dust, suggesting Elen had avoided ascending into the unstable upper reaches where hidden threats--possibly a gargoyle or shadowy creature--might lurk.\n\nPrioritizing the search for Elen, the party chose not to investigate the potential dangers in the tower further and instead followed her trail toward the Great Hall. Moving quietly past the base of the spiral stairs to avoid disturbing the dust or attracting unseen threats, they entered the passage partially blocked by rubble and shadow. Moonlight through barred windows illuminated Elen's tracks weaving among debris, broken banners, and toppled beams.\n\nUpon pushing open the battered door to the Great Hall, the party noticed a chill in the air and their breath fogging before them. The vast chamber was strewn with broken tables and shattered armor, evoking a scene of past violence. At the far end, they spotted a fragment of blue fabric and a brief flicker of movement--likely Elen slipping deeper into the keep. Though distant sounds of grinding stone hinted that dangers still lingered elsewhere in the tower, the path to follow Elen's trail deeper into Shadowfall Keep lay open.\n\nThe visit concluded with the party resolutely pressing onward, guided by the evidence and their determination to find Scout Elen."

Upon arrival, they found the Spectral Scribe, a translucent figure endlessly writing at a phantom desk, and sensed the presence of spectral servants and a lurking mimic disguised as an ornate chair.\n\nNorn approached the Spectral Scribe, introduced himself, and expressed his intent to find and protect a scout named Elen. The Scribe revealed that Elen fled through the keep, hunted by the curse afflicting the place, and spoke of lost journal pages scattered throughout the hall that held keys to lifting the curse. He warned that not all present were what they seemed.\n\nWhile searching, Norn discovered one of the Scribe's lost journal pages beneath a toppled goblet. A phantom servant offered spectral wine in apparent hospitality, but Norn declined and instead shot an arrow at the mimic. This initiated combat with the mimic, which was swiftly defeated. From the mimic's remains, Norn recovered Lord Vael's signet ring, a ceremonial dagger, an enchanted goblet, and the Family Chronicle tome.\n\nAfter tending to his acid burns and wounds, and examining the recovered items, Norn continued searching the Great Hall, locating a second journal page, ancient coins, and a coded parchment. No further pages were found despite a thorough search.\n\nUsing the recovered signet ring, Norn unlocked the ornate door to the Lord's Study. Exercising caution, he performed an Investigation check (total 16) and found no traps at the threshold. Entering the study, he observed recent bootprints--likely Elen's--leading behind the grand desk. The study was laden with moldering tomes, maps, letters, and an untouched goblet, all steeped in the keep's sorrowful history.\n\nThe visit concluded with Norn poised to search the study further for Elen and the secrets that might lift the keep's curse, his wounds aching but resolve firm. The spectral inhabitants kept their distance, acknowledging his progress, while the keep's ancient sorrows lingered heavily in the air."

Calling out to Elen summoned the spectral Shadow of Sir Garran, who challenged them, leading to a tense confrontation.\n\nAfter combat, the Shadow dissipated, leaving behind an ornate iron key and a battered leather journal detailing Sir Garran's struggle against a corrupting relic and hinting at a hidden chamber below. The arcane containment circle ceased glowing, and the oppressive cold lifted, signaling the party's victory. They secured the key and journal, noting a trapdoor beneath the rug now revealed.\n\nOpting not to disturb the magically warded bookshelves further, the party pulled back the rug and uncovered the locked trapdoor adorned with shadow-absorbing gems matching those in the key. A careful Investigation revealed dormant necrotic wards neutralized by their prior victory and possession of the key. Using the key, they unlocked and opened the trapdoor, which led to a descending stone staircase.\n\nThe party descended into the Cursed Dungeons below Shadowfall Keep.

They searched the room for signs of Elen and discovered compelling evidence: a faint, familiar bootprint, a torn piece of her scout's cloak, and a silver hair atop recently disturbed prisoner ledgers.\n\nInvestigating the ledgers revealed a chilling entry stating that \"Scout E.\" (Elen) had been brought below, alongside cryptic mentions of \"shadows that walk like men\" and a mysterious chamber beneath. The ledgers contained eerie names, including those not yet born, implying a temporal distortion within the dungeon.\n\nWhile examining the desk, the party triggered a magical trap--the Shadow Sigil--casting the room into magical darkness and summoning a malevolent Shadow creature. A tense combat ensued, during which the party faced the risk of exhaustion from the trap's draining effect. Ultimately, they defeated the Shadow, dispelling the darkness and leaving behind only a faint black smear and a lingering curse.\n\nFollowing the combat, the party recovered their composure and chose to rest briefly, using three Hit Dice to regain 26 hit points, restoring their vitality for the challenges ahead.\n\nWith renewed strength, they proceeded west through an ancient iron door marked with runes of imprisonment, entering the Gaol. Inside, they found a narrow corridor lined with barred cells, dimly lit by flickering blue sconces. The air was thick with despair and haunted by the faint sounds of scraping chains and distant weeping. The presence of unnatural shadows suggested ongoing dangers lurking within.\n\nThroughout the visit, the party gathered vital clues about Elen's recent passage through the dungeon and the dark forces at work, faced and overcame a deadly magical trap and its summoned Shadow, and positioned themselves to delve deeper into the Gaol to uncover more about Elen's fate."

A fierce combat ensued, resulting in both creatures being slain without harming the party, though their bodies blocked part of the corridor.\n\nAfter the battle, the party searched the area and recovered a tarnished iron key ring with three ancient keys from the ghoul's corpse, as well as a battered journal and a pouch containing 21 slightly corroded gold coins from the mouther's former cell. The journal, Sergeant Ralth's Gaol Log, detailed the keep's collapse into madness, the appearance of a \"thing of mouths,\" and mentioned a guarded secret involving the \"Knight of Grief.\" A hastily drawn map marked cell seven with the cryptic note: \"The echo holds her pain, heart is the key.\"\n\nContinuing their search, the party found most cells empty except cell seven, which contained a spectral echo of Scout Elen trapped in a loop of terror and confusion. They also discovered a hidden compartment in the guard station desk housing an echo crystal--an artifact capable of replaying stored voices--and a parchment listing prisoner names, some ominously marked.\n\nInteracting with Elen's echo revealed crucial information: the \"heart\" and an unfulfilled promise by Sir Garran were key to breaking the curse afflicting the Gaol. Elen urged the party to proceed deeper through the old Guard Post, warning that the curse's hunger persisted and that danger awaited beyond.\n\nFollowing her guidance, the party used one of the ancient keys to unlock a heavy iron door leading to a shadowed corridor deeper within the dungeons, where Sir Garran's secrets and further challenges awaited.

The wight fired a crossbow bolt while the shadow mastiff attempted to flank them. The party successfully defeated both adversaries without injury, earning 1,150 experience points.\n\nIn the aftermath, the party searched the chamber for signs of Scout Elen and useful items. They discovered evidence that Elen had passed through recently--a scrap of blue thread from her cloak in a bootprint--and a hastily marked duty roster warning of a special prisoner moved below and the restless shadows. Among the finds were a hidden compartment beneath a desecrated shrine containing a potion marked with a heroism sigil and a folded page penned by the Spectral Scribe, which contained cryptic advice about the curse and Elen's flight. The party also found a crude map indicating a concealed passage to the Forgotten Ossuary and a ring of keys for storage lockers along the wall.\n\nFurther investigation of the desecrated shrine revealed it had once been a place of protective power against undead, now defiled by shadowy sigils. The party's successful Religion check restored the shrine through consecration, causing it to radiate a protective blessing. This blessing granted +2 AC against undead attacks for eight hours, weakening the curse's hold on the room and bolstering the party's defenses.\n\nWith the shrine restored, the party considered their next moves.

The passage led them out of the Guard Post into the vast, silent Forgotten Ossuary--a crypt filled with bone shelves and relics, heavy with memories and unseen presences.\n\nThe visit concluded with the party stepping cautiously into the ossuary's shadows, prepared to face the next challenges of their quest to uncover Elen's fate and confront the curse at Shadowfall Keep's heart."

At the center stood the Bone Speaker, a skeletal figure whose dissonant chorus of voices challenged Norn to explain the purpose of disturbing the restless dead and what was known of Sir Garran's tale.\n\nRecalling memories and lore, Norn remembered that Sir Garran was a noble knight betrayed by a scribe who unleashed a curse through forbidden rituals involving a shadow relic. The knight's heart amulet, now in Norn's possession, was a fragment of Garran's spirit, capable of warding against the relic's corruption and instrumental in breaking the curse. Scout Elen, partially ensnared by the curse, was key to restoring the keep's wards and required rescue.\n\nNorn declared an oathbound mission to restore broken oaths, recover Elen if she still lived, and break the curse so the dead could rest. The Bone Speaker posed three spectral questions concerning the scribe's betrayal, the heart amulet's power, and Elen's fate. After a successful History check, Norn answered with detailed truths: the scribe's betrayal unleashed darkness; the heart amulet could weaken or purify the shadow relic when used with genuine intent; and Elen was trapped but not lost, requiring the amulet and restoration of Garran's oath for her salvation.\n\nUpon hearing the truthful answers, the Bone Speaker recognized Norn's honor and opened the grand archway to the Relic Chamber. Norn chose to proceed, descending a stairway glowing with eerie blue and violet light into a chamber thick with spectral energy. There, the vengeful spirit of Lord Thaddeus Greymont, corrupted by shadow magic, confronted Norn alongside a half-shadowed, chained Scout Elen. Greymont challenged Norn's intentions, setting the stage for a pivotal confrontation that would determine the fate of the keep, Elen, and the curse itself.\n\nThe visit concluded as Norn faced this crucial moment, bearing the knight's heart amulet and the burden of restoring peace to the Forgotten Ossuary."

Elen was found trapped and partially consumed by the shadow's grasp at the altar's edge.\n\nA fierce battle ensued, pitting the party against Lord Greymont's spectral wrath, the shadow relic's corruption, and the crawling darkness itself. After overcoming these challenges, the party shattered the Shadow Relic, causing the dark essence to dissipate and the Shadow Manifestations to vanish. The curse lifted, warmth returned to the chamber, spectral chains binding Elen dissolved, and Lord Greymont appeared peaceful, expressing gratitude for his and others' release from torment.\n\nThe party tended to Elen, who was badly shaken but bore no life-threatening injuries--only bruises, cuts, and necrotic burns from the shadow's grasp. She expressed heartfelt thanks, acknowledging that the whispers and darkness were gone. The party recovered several valuable items from the chamber: Sir Garran's now-purified sword, a vial of shadow essence, a chest containing gold, gemstones, and a keep deed, an ancient scroll detailing the relic's creation, and a protective silver amulet.\n\nWith the relic's curse lifted, the chamber's runes burned pure, and a peaceful silence settled over the keep.

The corridors were silent, and the oppressive chill of the dungeon had dissipated, replaced by gentle morning light.\n\nThe party took advantage of this respite to recover. Norn requested Elen to cast Cure Wounds multiple times, receiving healing that eased wounds and bruises from their recent battles. Elen initially appeared to have limited first-level spell slots, but after clarification, she confirmed having two first-level and two second-level spells still available, allowing her to provide one more healing spell to Norn before resting.\n\nFollowing the healing, the party took a short rest near the shrine, using the time to tend wounds and regain strength. During this pause, Norn engaged Elen in conversation, learning that she had entered the dungeon through a hidden entrance beneath brambles, aided by a bronze key from Mirna, and had been pursued by a supernatural threat tied to the curse. Elen expressed gratitude for Norn's hope and persistence, acknowledging their shared survival as a bond stronger than any treasure.\n\nFeeling restored and ready to leave, the party decided to exit via the gate near the trailhead.

The inn's comforting atmosphere offered a much-needed respite, signaling the close of this chapter but also the promise of new opportunities and responsibilities ahead.\n\nThis visit concluded with the villagers' fears lifted and hope restored, cementing Elen's heroic status and deepening bonds between key NPCs and the party.

The innkeeper, Cira, welcomed them with heartening smiles and a promise of stew and fresh loaf--an earnest feast in honor of their recent trials. Settling by the crackling hearth, the pair were met with quiet salutes from villagers whose eyes shimmered with gratitude and relief, creating an atmosphere thick with the balm of safety and fellowship.\n\nAs Norn and Elen took a short rest, they shared vivid recountings of their harrowing journey through the cursed Gloamwood and the fateful confrontation with Lord Greymont. The tension of those dark days softened as laughter blossomed between them, especially over the memory of Norn's near-fatal encounter with a mimic disguised as a chair. Elen's honest laughter and warm gaze revealed a depth of trust and camaraderie born of shared peril. The bond between them grew stronger, underscored by mutual respect and a tacit acknowledgment of their intertwined fates.\n\nIn a gesture weighted with gratitude and hope, Norn slid a small chest of gold across the table to Elen, declaring it hers though retaining the deed to Shadowfall Keep. The room stilled slightly as villagers noted the solemnity of the exchange. Elen's eyes glistened with emotion as she accepted the treasure, vowing to use it to aid the village's recovery. Her hand clasped Norn's in a moment that fused resolve with tenderness, embodying both the burden and promise of their shared legacy.\n\nThe inn's warmth deepened as stories unfolded to a pair of wide-eyed children eager for legends of the Gloamwood's terrors and triumphs. Norn's detailed narration of the mimic's breathing and hunger captivated the room, weaving fear and bravery into a tale that would linger in the village's collective memory. Cira's wry commentary and the villagers' respectful nods underscored the community's reliance on these heroes to guard against creeping darkness.\n\nAs the night waned, the atmosphere remained buoyant with laughter and hope.

Mirna invited them in, eager to hear the full account of their harrowing battle to lift an ancient curse, during which Scout Elen's bravery shone brightest. The store fell silent as the tale unfolded--dark corridors, spectral foes, and relentless courage--drawing a blush from Elen as she received heartfelt praise.\n\nIn recognition, Mirna unlocked a battered coffer containing gold coins, gleaming gemstones, and a deed to a plot of land west of the village, symbolizing the village's profound thanks and a tangible stake in its future. Elen's quiet gratitude and hopeful words underscored the emotional weight of this gift, binding the heroes ever closer to Harrow's Hollow.\n\nThe conversation turned playfully toward settling into the old keep--a haunted relic of the village--and Elder Mirna pledged the community's support for restoration efforts, offering supplies and skilled hands. This sparked a shared vision of reclaiming not only the land but the spirit of the keep itself.\n\nThe party then presented a jeweled dagger found in the keep to Mirna, who identified it as a finely crafted relic of the Vael line, imbued with minor enchantments and steeped in history. Though no curse lingered on the blade, Mirna suggested a ritual by the village sage for deeper insight, hinting at untold stories yet to be uncovered.\n\nAfter resolving a brief inventory glitch to reclaim their full treasure, the party's bond deepened when the player gifted Elen the cloak of elvenkind. Her surprise melted into joy and pride, the cloak transforming into a symbol of her newfound stature and readiness to confront future shadows. The tender moment culminated with a gentle kiss on Elen's cheek, fostering warmth and camaraderie that brightened the store's atmosphere, witnessed with quiet approval by Mirna.\n\nWith their hearts lightened and spirits lifted, the duo left the store amidst cheers and well-wishes, heading to the Wyrd Lantern Inn. There, Cira greeted them with open arms and free pints, celebrating their victory and the dawning of a hopeful new chapter. Raising mugs in honor of Shadowfall Keep's restoration, they embraced a moment of peace, camaraderie, and the promise of adventures yet to come--a day etched indelibly into their shared story and the heart"

This quiet exchange of trust and affection set the emotional tone for their stay, as villagers around celebrated both survival and renewal.\n\nElen spoke candidly of her conflicting desires--to build roots in Harrow's Hollow and to chase the restless call of distant legends. Tales from traveling merchants and a local peddler ignited their imaginations: a silver river that flows uphill, haunted ruins at the Thorn Coast, and shadow-haunted fey woods. Together, they chose to pursue the mystery of the Silver Vein River, embracing adventure with light packs and eager hearts.\n\nCira, the innkeeper and guardian spirit of the Wyrd Lantern, proved an invaluable ally, offering safe storage in a sturdy iron-bound chest for their excess belongings and supplying essential gear--bedrolls, rations, fresh rope, and torches--without hesitation. Norn bartered wisely, trading gold and treasured relics to outfit Elen with finely enchanted studded leather armor, boots that muffle footsteps, and a hunter's sash, upgrading her readiness for the wilds ahead. In a deeply personal gesture, Norn bestowed upon Elen the Amulet of Natural Armor and the Ring of Protection, symbolizing not only protection but a shared commitment to their journey and to each other. Elen's gratitude and playful affection--sealed with a kiss on the cheek--illuminated the quiet intimacy forged in the inn's golden lamplight.\n\nAs the afternoon waned, plans solidified to press onward before dusk, embracing the risks and rewards of traveling into Sablemoor's mist-shrouded marshes. With their packs lightened of burdensome keepsakes--secured safely in the inn's chest--and spirits buoyed by companionship and purpose, Norn and Elen stepped out together into the crisp air, leaving behind the hearth's warm glow for the uncertain road. The Wyrd Lantern Inn stood as both sanctuary and springboard, a place where promises were made and legends awaited.\n\nThis visit left an indelible mark: a quiet"
