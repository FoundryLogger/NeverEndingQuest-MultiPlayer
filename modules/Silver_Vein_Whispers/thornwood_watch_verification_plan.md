# The_Thornwood_Watch Module Synchronization Verification Plan

## Objective
Verify that all files in The_Thornwood_Watch module are properly synchronized, focusing on location IDs, connections, and references between files.

## Files to Check
1. **Area files**: NCW001.json, RO001.json, TW001.json
2. **Map files**: map_NCW001.json, map_RO001.json, map_TW001.json  
3. **Context file**: module_context.json

## Verification Steps
1. Extract location IDs from each area file
2. Extract location IDs from each corresponding map file
3. Check module_context.json for location ID references
4. Cross-reference all files for consistency
5. Generate summary report

## Expected Synchronization Points
- Location IDs should match between area files and their corresponding map files
- Connections between areas should be consistent
- module_context.json should reference valid location IDs
- No broken references or mismatched IDs
