## Connection Verification

### Area to Area Connections
**NCW001 connections**:
- NC01 → TW001 (via areaConnectivityId)
- TW05 → NCW001 (via areaConnectivityId)
**Status**: ✓ SYNCHRONIZED - Bidirectional connection established

**RO001 connections**:
- RO01 → TW001 (via areaConnectivityId)
- TW01 → RO001 (via areaConnectivityId)
**Status**: ✓ SYNCHRONIZED - Bidirectional connection established

### Internal Location Connections
All internal connections within each area match perfectly between area files and map files:

**NCW001**: All location connectivity arrays match map room connections
**RO001**: All location connectivity arrays match map room connections  
**TW001**: All location connectivity arrays match map room connections

## Module Context Analysis

### NPC Location References
All NPCs in module_context.json are correctly referenced with valid location IDs:
- Ranger Elen → RO01 ✓
- Quartermaster Brann → RO02 ✓
- Trader Sila → RO03 ✓
- Scout Neris → RO04 ✓
- Captured Bandit Leader Rusk → RO05 ✓
- Wounded Scout Neris → TW01 ✓
- Rescued Merchant Lira → TW03 ✓
- Spirit-Touched Hermit Maelo → TW04 ✓
- The Withered Hart → NC03 ✓

### Area ID References
All area IDs in module_context.json match the area files:
- RO001: "Rangers' Outpost" ✓
- TW001: "Thornwood Wilds" ✓
- NCW001: "Northern Corrupted Woods" ✓

## Layout Verification

### Map Layout Consistency
All map files have consistent layout grids that match their room connections:

**NCW001 Layout**: 2x3 grid properly represents room positions
**RO001 Layout**: 3x3 grid properly represents room positions
**TW001 Layout**: 2x3 grid properly represents room positions

## Coordinate System Analysis

### Coordinate Consistency
All rooms use consistent X,Y coordinate systems:
- Coordinates in area files match coordinates in map files
- Layout positions correspond correctly to coordinate values
- No duplicate coordinates within any single area

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues
1. **One validation issue in module_context.json**: "NPC 'Corrupted Woodland Creatures' is referenced in ['module:plotStages'] but not placed in any location"
   - This is a minor issue that doesn't affect location ID synchronization
   - The NPC appears to be referenced in plot stages but not assigned to a specific location

### No Critical Issues
- No mismatched location IDs between area files and map files
- No broken connections or references
- No inconsistent coordinate systems
- No missing area connectivity references

## Recommendations

1. **Address validation issue**: Consider either placing "Corrupted Woodland Creatures" in a specific location or removing the reference from plot stages if not needed.

2. **Maintain current synchronization**: The module is well-synchronized and should be maintained at this standard for future updates.

## Conclusion

The Thornwood Watch module demonstrates excellent file synchronization. All location IDs, connections, coordinates, and references are properly aligned across area files, map files, and the context file. The module is ready for gameplay with no critical synchronization issues.

**Overall Grade: A** - Excellent synchronization with only one minor validation issue that doesn't impact gameplay functionality.
