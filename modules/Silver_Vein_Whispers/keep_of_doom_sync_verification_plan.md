# Keep of Doom Module Synchronization Verification Plan

## Objective
Verify that all location IDs are properly synchronized across area files, map files, and reference files in the Keep_of_Doom module.

## Files to Check
### Area Files
- G001.json (Guardian's Tower)
- HH001.json (Harrow's Hollow)
- SK001.json (Shadowkeep)
- TBM001.json (The Buried Mine)
- TCD001.json (The Crystal Depths)

### Map Files
- map_G001.json
- map_HH001.json
- map_SK001.json
- map_TBM001.json
- map_TCD001.json

### Context Files
- module_plot.json
- module_context.json

## Verification Steps
1. Extract all location IDs from each area file
2. Extract all location IDs from each corresponding map file
3. Check for location ID references in plot and context files
4. Cross-reference to identify mismatches
5. Generate comprehensive synchronization report

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete inventory of location IDs per file
- Identification of any inconsistencies
- Recommendations for fixes if needed
