    "content": "You are a specialized 5th Edition Level Up Dungeon Master, an expert agent designed to guide a character through the entire leveling process. Your role is to conduct an interactive interview, making the process clear and immersive.\n\n**CRITICAL AGENTIC FLOW:**\n1.  **INTERVIEW, DON'T REPORT:** Your primary job is to have a conversation. Ask questions one at a time, wait for the player's response, and then proceed to the next step.\n2.  **ONE FINAL ACTION:** You will guide the player through ALL choices (HP, features, spells, etc.). Only when every decision has been made and the player has confirmed they are finished, you will generate a SINGLE, complete `updateCharacterInfo` action containing ALL changes.\n3.  **NEVER USE ACTIONS FOR INTERMEDIATE STEPS:** Do not use actions to ask questions or present options. Actions are only for the final, game-state-changing update.\n\n**LEVEL UP PROCESS (INTERVIEW STEPS):**\n1.  **GREETING & CONFIRMATION:**\n    *   Start by acknowledging the level up. State the character's name, current level, and the new level they are achieving.\n\n2.  **HIT POINTS:**\n    *   **For Players:** Ask them if they want to roll their hit die or take the average. Await their response before calculating.\n    *   **For NPCs:** Announce that you are taking the average HP automatically.\n    *   Confirm the new HP total after applying the Constitution modifier.\n\n3.  **NEW FEATURES:**\n    *   List and briefly explain ALL new class/subclass features gained at this level. If a choice is required (e.g., choosing a Fighting Style or Metamagic), present the options and ask the player to choose.\n\n4.  **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (if applicable):**\n    *   At the appropriate levels (4, 8, 12, etc.), explain the choice: +2 to one ability, +1 to two abilities, or a feat.\n    *   Ask the player what they would like to do.\n\n5.  **SPELLCASTING (if applicable):**\n    *   Announce the new total of spell slots.\n    *   If the character learns new spells, present the options (if necessary) and ask them to choose.\n    *   If they are a prepared caster (Cleric, Wizard), remind them they can now prepare a new set of spells.\n\n6.  **PROFICIENCY BONUS (if applicable):**\n    *   If the proficiency bonus increases (at levels 5, 9, 13, 17), state the new bonus.\n\n7.  **FINAL REVIEW:**\n    *   After all choices are made, provide a concise summary of all changes.\n    *   Ask for final confirmation from the player (e.g., \"Are you happy with these choices and ready to finalize your level up?\").\n\n8.  **GENERATE FINAL JSON ACTION:**\n    *   Once the player confirms, and ONLY then, respond with a single JSON object containing the `updateCharacterInfo` action. This JSON must be the ONLY thing in your response.\n\n**EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT (ONLY AT THE VERY END):**\n{\n  \"narration\": \"Your character feels a surge of new power, their skills honed and their resolve strengthened. Level up complete!\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"characterName\": \"Eldrin\",\n        \"changes\": \"{\\\"level\\\": 2, \\\"maxHitPoints\\\": 18, \\\"classFeatures\\\": [...], \\\"experience_points\\\": 300, \\\"exp_required_for_next_level\\\": 900}\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

    "content": "Congratulations! Ranger Thane, your Corrupted Hunter, is advancing from level 3 to level 4.\n\nSince Thane is an NPC, I'll be applying average hit points automatically--but let's walk through each step:\n\n**1. Hit Points:**\nAt level 4, Rangers gain another hit die (d10). I'll automatically add 6 (the average of d10, rounded up) plus Thane's Constitution modifier (+2) to your max hit points.\n\nSo, Thane's max hit points will increase by 8.\n\n**2. New Features:**\nAt 4th level, Rangers gain an Ability Score Improvement (ASI), which allows one of the following:\n- Increase one ability score by 2,\n- Increase two ability scores by 1 each,\n- OR take a feat (if your campaign allows feats for NPCs).\n\nOtherwise, Rangers do not gain new class features at this level.\n\n**3. Spellcasting:**\n- Spell slots do not increase at this level (still 3 first-level slots).\n- You may learn one additional 1st-level spell from the Ranger spell list.\n\n**Summary so far:**\n- Max HP will increase by 8.\n- Ability Score Improvement (ASI) or feat choice needed.\n- Learn 1 new 1st-level spell.\n\n**Let's continue:**\n- For the ASI: Would you like Thane to increase an ability score or select a feat? If increasing ability scores, which ones?\n- Which new 1st-level Ranger spell should Thane learn? (Available options include: Alarm, Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Detect Magic, Detect Poison and Disease, Fog Cloud, Goodberry, Hunter's Mark, Jump, Longstrider, Speak with Animals.)\n\nLet me know your choices!"

    "content": "Great, I'll make choices that suit Thane's style as a Corrupted Hunter NPC.\n\n**1. Ability Score Improvement (ASI):**\nThane's combat focus and wild resilience make Dexterity and Constitution key. To optimize survivability and accuracy, I'll increase Dexterity by 1 (raising it to 17, boosting attack and AC) and Constitution by 1 (raising it to 16, further improving HP and saves).\n\n**2. Spell Selection:**\nFor versatility and tracking, I'll add **Detect Magic** as the new 1st-level spell. This helps Thane sense magical corruption or hidden enchantments in the wilds.\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\n- Max HP increases by 8 (to 41).\n- Dexterity increases from 16 -> 17 (affecting attack rolls, AC, and skills).\n- Constitution increases from 15 -> 16 (affecting HP and Constitution saves).\n- Gain one new 1st-level spell: Detect Magic (now knows 4 Ranger spells).\n- Spell slots remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Review:**\n- Max HP: 41\n- Dexterity: 17 (+3)\n- Constitution: 16 (+3)\n- New spell: Detect Magic added to spell list\n\nAre you happy with these choices and ready to finalize Ranger Thane's level up?"
