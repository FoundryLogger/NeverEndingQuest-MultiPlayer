# Introductory Module Specification: "The Ranger's Call"

## Module Creation Instructions

### **Core Purpose & Requirements**
This introductory module serves as a **gateway adventure** for new players, establishing key characters and connections that lead directly into the Keep of Doom module. The module must accomplish specific narrative goals while maintaining classic 5th edition adventure structure.

### **Critical Character Integration: Elen the Ranger**

**Primary Requirement**: Elen must serve as the **main quest-giver** for 2-3 sessions, then depart on her surveillance mission. This establishes her competence and dedication while setting up her eventual disappearance in Keep of Doom.

**Elen's Character Arc**:
- **Session 1-2**: Active quest-giver and information source
- **Session 3**: Field coordinator from safe positions  
- **Session 4**: Departure for long-term surveillance mission

**Safety Protocol**: Elen must **NEVER** be placed in direct combat situations. She provides intelligence, coordinates from secure positions, and maintains professional distance. If party invites her to join permanently, she must refuse with clear reasoning tied to her ranger duties.

- Area 3: 2-3 coordination points (field camp, observation post, departure crossroads)

### **Plot Themes & Objectives**

- Elen's analysis reveals pattern of supernatural disturbances
- Growing evidence points toward ancient ruins as threat source

#### **Session 3: The Revelation**
**Location**: Coordination point between village and wilderness  
**Elen's Role**: Intelligence analyst and mission planner

**Major Development**: Combined intelligence reveals significant supernatural awakening requiring long-term surveillance. Elen must establish permanent monitoring post.

**The Decision**: Elen explains she cannot continue working with the party as her mission requires extended solitary observation. Professional departure with mutual respect.

### **Key Dialogue Framework**

#### **Elen's Mission Explanation**:
*"The disturbances you've helped me track are building toward something larger. I need to establish a surveillance post to monitor whatever's stirring in those ancient ruins. This isn't a quick adventure - it's a guardian's duty that could take weeks or months."*

#### **Party Invitation Refusal**:
*"I wish I could join you, but this mission requires stealth and solitary observation. Groups make noise, leave tracks, draw attention. Someone needs to be the early warning system for all the villages in this region."*

#### **Connection to Future Adventures**:
*"If anything major develops, I'll get word to [Village Elder/Mirna]. She knows how to reach experienced adventurers when the situation demands it."*

### **Combat & Encounter Guidelines**

**Elen's Safety Protocols**:
- Never include Elen in combat encounters
- Position her at secure observation points or safe base camps
- If combat occurs near her position, she retreats or takes cover
- Party handles all direct confrontations while she provides intelligence

**Encounter Scaling**:
- Level 1 characters: 1-2 bandits, 1-3 goblins, single beast encounters
