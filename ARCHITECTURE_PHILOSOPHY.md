# D&D Dungeon Master System - Architecture Philosophy

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Modular Event-Driven Architecture**
Our system follows a clean separation of concerns with distinct layers that communicate through well-defined interfaces. Every game interaction is processed as a discrete action, enabling consistent state management and easy extensibility.

### 2. **AI-First Design with Human Safety Nets**
While AI drives the narrative and game logic, multiple validation layers ensure correctness. We embrace AI capabilities while maintaining strict data integrity through schema validation, response verification, and graceful error handling.

### 3. **Data Integrity Above All**
Every data operation is atomic, validated, and recoverable. We use JSON schemas, backup mechanisms, file locking, and multi-layer validation to ensure game state consistency even under failure conditions.

### 4. **Module-Centric Hub-and-Spoke Architecture with Timeline Preservation**
Our revolutionary module system uses geographic boundaries rather than narrative chapters. Each area network forms a self-contained module, with intelligent conversation segmentation preserving chronological adventure history. This creates a living, interconnected world where players can revisit any area while maintaining complete context through AI-generated adventure summaries and seamless timeline preservation.

### 5. **Unified Character Management**
All characters (players, NPCs, monsters) use consistent schemas and processing patterns while allowing for role-specific behavior. This simplifies maintenance and ensures consistent game mechanics.

## Architectural Patterns

### **MVC + Command Pattern + Strategy Pattern**
- **Model**: JSON-based persistent storage with schema validation
- **View**: Console interface with real-time status feedback
- **Controller**: Main game loop with centralized action processing
- **Command**: All interactions encapsulated as typed actions with parameters
- **Strategy**: Configurable AI models for different game aspects

### **Layered Architecture**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User Interface Layer (Console + Web)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Action Processing Layer (Commands)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  AI Integration Layer (Multiple Models) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Game Systems Layer (Combat, Location)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Data Management Layer (Files, Paths)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Validation Layer (Schema, Integrity)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Data Flow Philosophy

### **Unidirectional Data Flow**
```
User Input → Action Parsing → AI Processing → Validation → State Update → Persistence
```

### **State Synchronization Strategy**
- Central game state in `party_tracker.json`
- Conversation history maintains AI context
- Real-time state updates across all game systems
- Atomic state transitions with rollback capability

## File Organization Principles

### **Module-Centric File Structure**

```

### **ID and Naming Conventions**
- **Location IDs**: Area prefix + sequential number (HH001, G001)
- **Character Files**: Lowercase with underscores (norn.json, test_guard.json)
- **Encounter IDs**: Location-encounter format (B02-E1)
- **File Locking**: .lock suffix for concurrent access protection

## AI Integration Philosophy

### **Multi-Model Strategy**
- **Primary DM**: Main narrative and game logic (GPT-4 or Claude)
- **Combat Manager**: AI-driven turn-based combat simulation with validation
- **Character Effects Validator**: AI-powered temporary effects validation system
- **Level Up Manager**: AI-guided character progression with D&D 5e rule compliance

4. **State Validation**: Game state consistency checks
5. **Reference Validation**: Cross-file integrity verification

## Module Transition System

### **Intelligent Conversation Segmentation**
Our module transition system preserves chronological adventure history through advanced conversation timeline management:
- **Immediate Detection**: Module transitions detected in `action_handler.py` when party tracker changes
- **Smart Boundary Detection**: Two-condition logic for optimal conversation compression
- **AI Summary Integration**: Full adventure summaries loaded from campaign_summaries folder
- **Timeline Preservation**: Chronological adventure sequence maintained across all modules

### **Two-Condition Boundary Logic**
```
Condition 1: Previous Module Transition Exists
└─ Compress conversation between the two module transitions

Condition 2: No Previous Module Transition  
└─ Compress from after last system message to current transition
```

### **Conversation Timeline Architecture**
```
[System Message] → [Module Summary] → [Module Transition] → [New Module Conversation]
```

### **Sequential Archive Strategy**
- **Immediate Archiving**: Full conversation history preserved in campaign_archives/
- **AI Chronicle Generation**: Detailed adventure summaries created in campaign_summaries/
- **Sequential Numbering**: Automatic sequence tracking for chronological timeline
- **Context Restoration**: Complete adventure context available for return visits

## AI-Powered NPC Validation System

### **Intelligent Character Registry**
Our NPC Codex system solves the critical problem of AI narrative validation by automatically generating comprehensive NPC registries for each module using GPT-4 analysis:

- **AI-Powered Extraction**: Scans plot files and area descriptions to identify all legitimate NPCs
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Distinguishes NPCs from locations, monsters, and generic titles
- **Source Attribution**: Tracks whether NPCs come from plot, locations, or character files
- **Bulletproof Validation**: Prevents AI from inventing non-existent characters during gameplay

### **NPC Codex Architecture**
