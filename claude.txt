As you drape it around Elen's shoulders, her eyes go wide with surprise, then soften with a bright, grateful smile that outshines any magic in the room. Elen runs her fingers over the fine weave, marveling at the way the fabric seems to gather the shadows and melt into the background. \\\"Norn,\\\" she murmurs, her voice low with emotion, \\\"this is... I don't think I've ever owned anything so fine, or so clever. Are you sure?\\\"\\n\\nYou nod, and she settles the cloak around herself, standing a little taller. \\\"Thank you,\\\" she says, voice firm now. \\\"I promise to put it to good use. Besides, if we really are going to play house in that haunted keep, I expect the ghosts won't even see me coming.\\\"\\n\\nElder Mirna beams at the exchange. \\\"A gift like that is worth a dozen tales, and twice as many saved lives. This village truly does have its champions.\\\"\\n\\nElen's new cloak seems to settle around her like a badge of honor--a sign that, whatever new darkness waits on the horizon, she will stand ready to meet it by your side.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"characterName\": \"norn\",\n        \"changes\": \"Removed 'Cloak of Elvenkind' from inventory.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"characterName\": \"Elen\",\n        \"changes\": \"Added 'Cloak of Elvenkind' to inventory.
