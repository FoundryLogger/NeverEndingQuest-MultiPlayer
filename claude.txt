Greenwatch has always relied on brave souls, but now we face shadows within and without.\\\"\\n\\nShe gestures gently to the crowd and then the woods beyond the square. \\\"Folk have vanished in the night--friends, family, even one of our wardens. Some claim ghostly lights flicker in the Wilds, and animals flee from places they once called home. Worse, we've found signs that someone here is working against us, tampering with our stores and sowing fear.\\\"\\n\\nMirna's hand rests momentarily on the Cleansing Bell, the old bronze instrument shining faintly. \\\"This bell is all that stands between us and panic. At dawn, we ring it in ritual to remind folk that Greenwatch endures. But faith falters when danger walks so close, and it's said the bell's power depends on our unity.\\\"\\n\\nShe searches your face for understanding. \\\"Eirik, I need your help to restore that unity. Speak to the folk, listen for anything out of place, and help me lead the ritual at the next dawn. If we can drive out what haunts us--or at least stand together--we have a chance. Will you help me with this, and keep your eyes and heart open for secrets that may lie hidden in plain sight?\\\"\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 2\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

When you're ready, join me for the dawn ritual -- but every answer you find before then will help.\\\"\\n\\nThe square is alive with whispers, sidelong glances, and the promise of hidden truths.
