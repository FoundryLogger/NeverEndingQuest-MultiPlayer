Reason: The response advances to combat_round 2 before all creatures have acted in round 1. According to the initiative order (Norn → Animated Armor), Norn took their turn, then the Animated Armor attacked. However, the Animated Armor's attack is being processed in round 2, not round 1. The round should only increment after both Norn and the Animated Armor have acted in round 1.
