Kira perches on a barrel beside you, twirling an arrow between nimble fingers as she considers your question. Her brow furrows in thought, her voice quieting just a touch. 'Honestly, Eirik, we did more than most ever could. Malarok's dead, the Voidstone's shattered, and the bandits have finally scattered to the wilds. The outpost is safe for the first time in months.'

Commander Elen, hearing the question, steps over with a confident nod. 'You broke the back of the threat here. With the frontier secure, our job turns to rebuilding and watching for any remnants who might try to regroup. The rangers are already sweeping the woods for stragglers, and I've sent word to the neighboring communities. If another would-be tyrant tries to rise in these wilds, we'll have warning.'

Kira gives a small, satisfied smile, but she leans close and lowers her voice. 'Still, I wouldn't be surprised if some of Malarok's old magic or one of his lieutenants tries to stir up trouble again. And you know how bandits are--they never disappear for good.'

Elen adds, 'For now, your work here is truly done. If you want to help further, there are rumors from the north along the Gloamwood trail, and the merchants whisper of new dangers upriver. Or, if you wish, enjoy some peace and let the rangers handle things. You've earned it.'

Kira pats your shoulder. 'So, partner, ready for rest? Or does adventure call you elsewhere?'
