As a level 4 fighter, you have up to 4 Hit Dice, each a d10. For every Hit Die you spend, you roll a d10 and add your Constitution modifier (+3). The total is the number of hit points you regain. You can choose to spend as many of your available Hit Dice as you want, one at a time, during your rest.\\n\\nFor example, if you decide to spend 2 Hit Dice, you would roll 2d10, add your Constitution modifier to each die, and sum up the result to heal that many hit points. Once used, those Hit Dice are unavailable until you take a long rest, which restores half your maximum number of Hit Dice.\\n\\nWould you like to roll one or more Hit Dice for this short rest? Please let me know how many you'd like to use, roll those d10s, and tell me the results so I can update your hit points and mark the dice as spent.\",\n  \"actions\": []\n}"
