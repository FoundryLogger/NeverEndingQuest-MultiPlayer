üß™ Testing Agentic Character Creation
==================================================
üìö Scanning available modules...
üìñ Using module: Keep of Doom
   Description: Adventurers must brave a haunted keep to confront a cursed knight and a sinister artifact, risking supernatural doom or unleashing darkness upon the land.    
   Level range: {'min': 1, 'max': 3}

üé≠ Starting character creation...
==================================================
This will start an AI-guided character creation session.
You can type 'quit', 'exit', or 'cancel' at any time to stop.
When the AI asks if you're ready to finalize, say 'yes' to generate the JSON.

ü§ñ Starting character creation with AI assistant...
==================================================

ü§ñ Absolutely, I‚Äôd love to help you build your character for the Keep of Doom adventure!

Let‚Äôs start with the fun part: What kind of character are you imagining?
Are you thinking about a certain fantasy archetype (like sneaky rogue, mighty warrior, noble paladin, clever wizard, etc.), or do you want to explore some options?
If you already have a race or class in mind, let me know. If not, I can walk you through the possibilities‚Äîjust tell me if there‚Äôs a theme, vibe, or personality you want to play!

üë§ Your response: How about a clever wizzy

ü§ñ Great choice! A clever "wizzy" sounds like a classic wizard‚Äîsomeone intelligent, curious, and a master of arcane magic. Wizards are known for their wide spell selection and magical versatility.

Let‚Äôs nail down some details to bring your clever wizard to life:

1. **Race:** Do you have a preference? Here are some options that pair well with a wizard, but feel free to pick any:
   - **High Elf:** Bonus to Intelligence and Dexterity, plus extra skills and darkvision.
   - **Forest or Rock Gnome:** Bonus to Intelligence, some magical tricks, and darkvision.
   - **Human:** +1 to all ability scores and extra language.
   - **Tiefling:** Bonus to Intelligence and Charisma, darkvision, and innate magic.
   - Or another race‚Äîlet me know if you want a full list or details!

2. **Background:** This shapes your skills, starting equipment, and backstory. Examples: Sage (classic for wizards), Acolyte, Noble, or Urchin. Do you have a background in mind, or would you like options?

3. **Personality/Theme:** Is your wizard bookish, eccentric, ambitious, secretive, or something else? Any quirks or goals you want to play up?

Let me know your thoughts on race, background, and personality, or ask for suggestions!

üë§ Your response: oh, tiefling

ü§ñ Excellent! Tieflings make fascinating wizards: their infernal heritage gives them a boost to Intelligence and Charisma, along with darkvision, resistance to fire, and some innate spell-like abilities.

Let‚Äôs update your character so far:

- **Class:** Wizard
- **Race:** Tiefling
- **Theme:** Clever, arcane spellcaster

Next steps!
1. **Background:** This shapes your skills, proficiencies, and starting story. Some classic options for wizards are:
   - **Sage** (studied magic and lore)
   - **Acolyte** (religious scholar)
   - **Noble** (highborn, maybe a court mage)
   - **Charlatan** (con artist, trickster mage)
   - **Hermit** (lone researcher or magical outcast)
   - Or another‚Äîlet me know if you have a story in mind!

2. **Personality:** How do you picture your tiefling wizard? Shy or bold? Playful or serious? Any quirks, ideals, or goals?

3. **Ability Scores:** Wizards rely most on Intelligence (for spellcasting) and often value Dexterity or Constitution for defense. Would you like to roll for stats, use standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8), or point buy? I can help with any method.

Let‚Äôs start with your background and personality, or let me know if you want to talk ability scores first!

üë§ Your response: you chose all teh rest for me

ü§ñ You got it! I‚Äôll build your tiefling wizard using classic and fun choices, focusing on a clever, resourceful, and slightly mischievous arcane scholar.

Here‚Äôs my plan for the rest of the character:
- **Background:** Sage (classic for wizards, gives a scholarly vibe and lore skills)
- **Ability Scores:** Standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8), optimized for a clever wizard
- **Personality:** Curious, ambitious, quick-witted, sometimes a little too eager to test new spells
- **Alignment:** Neutral good (wants to use knowledge for the benefit of all)
- **Equipment:** Wizardly basics and a few personal touches
- **Spells:** A classic mix of wizard cantrips and 1st-level spells

**Quick Summary:**
- Race: Tiefling
- Class: Wizard
- Background: Sage
- Alignment: Neutral good
- Theme: Quick-witted, curious arcane scholar

Does this all sound good, or is there anything you‚Äôd like me to tweak before I proceed with the details?

üë§ Your response: yep, looks good

ü§ñ Awesome! Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the character components I‚Äôll finalize for your clever tiefling wizard:

- **Race:** Tiefling (bonuses: +2 Charisma, +1 Intelligence, darkvision, fire resistance, innate magic)
- **Class:** Wizard (spellcasting, Arcane Recovery)
- **Background:** Sage (Arcana & History skills, two languages, ‚ÄúResearcher‚Äù feature)
- **Ability Scores (Standard Array, racial bonuses included):**
  - Intelligence: Highest (for spellcasting)
  - Dexterity/Constitution: Next (for defense and HP)
  - Charisma: Boosted by race
- **Alignment:** Neutral Good
- **Personality:** Inquisitive, ambitious, always seeking new magical secrets
- **Spells:** Classic wizard cantrips and 1st-level spells

Final questions before I wrap up the details:
1. Would you like to pick your character‚Äôs name, or should I generate a fitting tiefling wizard name for you?
2. Any specific color, motif, or ‚Äúlook‚Äù you imagine for your tiefling (horns, tail, unusual features), or shall I leave that for you to imagine later?

Once you‚Äôre ready, just say so, and I‚Äôll finalize your character sheet!

üë§ Your response: Laura

ü§ñ Wonderful choice‚ÄîLaura is now the name of your clever tiefling wizard!

Here‚Äôs a final summary of your character:
- Name: Laura
- Race: Tiefling
- Class: Wizard
- Background: Sage
- Alignment: Neutral Good
- Personality: Inquisitive, ambitious, sharp-witted lover of arcane secrets

Unless you‚Äôd like to add any last-minute details, I‚Äôm ready to generate your complete character sheet for Laura. Would you like me to proceed and finalize everything?        

üë§ Your response: yes
