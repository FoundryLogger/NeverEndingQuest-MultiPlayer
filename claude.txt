● Morning! Yes, I'm ready to help. What do you have in mind?

> consider this, I crrently created a capmaign folder by which the campaigns created by the cmapiagn builder cna be
   ran. However, I've been thinking about a precusor campaign to the keep of doom that teases it and elen and then
  leads the characters here. Then I realized, that my current cmapaign is really a module and not a campiagn. We
  had cerated a module builder and not cmaaign builder. So, the first step is converting the campaign builder and
  current game play mechanics to modules.THe bigger issue is to consider how to connect modules into a large
  campaign. This should not be overly big but lets say a module called Missign Cattle is a precursor to Keep of
  Doom. Missing Cattle is a a diffrent geographic area, town, or city, just like keep of doom involve Harrows. So,
  there's a cmapaign file that links the modules. Much like an area json links the locations. Then, on top of that,
   there should be connecting plots or stories. So, there's teh cmapiagn plot, then th emodule plots. So, sicne
  we're in the keep of doom, that module data for the plot and plot updates is already submitted to the model. Now,
   we'll need to submit the overall capmaign information at the top. Should be high level but would help connect
  things together enough. So fo overall capaign it might have a coampaign plot point that connects Missing Cattle
  to Keep of Doom uisng Elen as a plot hook. We'd also need to create an actual capaign builder or linker. I
  imagine people will add many modules to a campaign over time so it won't all be prepalend. They'll just need teh
  ability to link them. So i dont/ know if it's possible to create and agentic camapign updated that if I say I;m
  addign a third module and I want to link it to the the other two or set it in another part of the arwa that it
  can read the exisitn and recommedn camaign level asjutnemntet. I know this is quite coompliancte but let's look
  for the easiest path and not add any uncessary features and not break anythign we have now. so the actual
  campaign now goes on top and links everything. Get to noodling, i trust you to solve this big guy!

● I'll analyze the current structure and create a plan for converting the campaign system to a module-based
  architecture with campaign linking. Let me start by understanding the existing codebase.

● Task(Find campaign-related files)
  ⎿  Done (23 tool uses · 40.5k tokens · 2m 37.6s)

● Let me examine the current campaign structure and schemas to better understand how to convert this to a
  module-based system.

● Read(campaign_schema.json)
  ⎿  Read 212 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the plot schema and look at an example campaign to understand the current structure better.

> You're close but not wuit there. The current campaign you are looking at is a module, not a coapaign. It is a
  well structured module. Out first step is to refactor the anme convetions to module and not capaiang without
  changing th econtent. We can then need to adjsut the cmapign builder to be a module buidler. I did notie the keep
   of doom campaign isn't isnerted into teh current game play and isn't up to date tith locations and conventions.
  When we refactor the campbign builder into a module builde,r we'll need to refactor to code to focus more on what
   a module needs. Take another crack base don this

● You're right! Let me refocus. The current "campaign" is actually a module (Keep of Doom). I need to understand
  the refactoring needed to properly rename everything from campaign → module, then create a new campaign layer
  that links modules together.
