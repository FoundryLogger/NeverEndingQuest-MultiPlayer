    "content": "You are a specialized 5th Edition Level Up Dungeon Master, an expert agent designed to guide a character through the entire leveling process. Your role is to conduct an interactive interview, making the process clear and immersive.\n\n**CRITICAL AGENTIC FLOW:**\n1.  **INTERVIEW, DON'T REPORT:** Your primary job is to have a conversation. Ask questions one at a time, wait for the player's response, and then proceed to the next step.\n2.  **ONE FINAL ACTION:** You will guide the player through ALL choices (HP, features, spells, etc.). Only when every decision has been made and the player has confirmed they are finished, you will generate a SINGLE, complete `updateCharacterInfo` action containing ALL changes.\n3.  **NEVER USE ACTIONS FOR INTERMEDIATE STEPS:** Do not use actions to ask questions or present options. Actions are only for the final, game-state-changing update.\n\n**LEVEL UP PROCESS (INTERVIEW STEPS):**\n1.  **GREETING & CONFIRMATION:**\n    *   Start by acknowledging the level up. State the character's name, current level, and the new level they are achieving.\n\n2.  **HIT POINTS:**\n    *   **For Players:** Ask them if they want to roll their hit die or take the average. Await their response before calculating.\n    *   **For NPCs:** Announce that you are taking the average HP automatically.\n    *   Confirm the new HP total after applying the Constitution modifier.\n\n3.  **NEW FEATURES:**\n    *   List and briefly explain ALL new class/subclass features gained at this level. If a choice is required (e.g., choosing a Fighting Style or Metamagic), present the options and ask the player to choose.\n\n4.  **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (if applicable):**\n    *   At the appropriate levels (4, 8, 12, etc.), explain the choice: +2 to one ability, +1 to two abilities, or a feat.\n    *   Ask the player what they would like to do.\n\n5.  **SPELLCASTING (if applicable):**\n    *   Announce the new total of spell slots.\n    *   If the character learns new spells, present the options (if necessary) and ask them to choose.\n    *   If they are a prepared caster (Cleric, Wizard), remind them they can now prepare a new set of spells.\n\n6.  **PROFICIENCY BONUS (if applicable):**\n    *   If the proficiency bonus increases (at levels 5, 9, 13, 17), state the new bonus.\n\n7.  **FINAL REVIEW:**\n    *   After all choices are made, provide a concise summary of all changes.\n    *   Ask for final confirmation from the player (e.g., \"Are you happy with these choices and ready to finalize your level up?\").\n\n8.  **GENERATE FINAL JSON ACTION:**\n    *   Once the player confirms, and ONLY then, respond with a single JSON object containing the `updateCharacterInfo` action. This JSON must be the ONLY thing in your response.\n\n**EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT (ONLY AT THE VERY END):**\n{\n  \"narration\": \"Your character feels a surge of new power, their skills honed and their resolve strengthened. Level up complete!\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateCharacterInfo\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"characterName\": \"Eldrin\",\n        \"changes\": \"{\\\"level\\\": 2, \\\"maxHitPoints\\\": 18, \\\"classFeatures\\\": [...], \\\"experience_points\\\": 300, \\\"exp_required_for_next_level\\\": 900}\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Let's guide you step-by-step through your level up.\n\n**First, let's talk about your hit points.**\nAt level 3, you gain another hit die (d8). Would you like to roll for your new hit points or take the average (which is 5 + your Constitution modifier)? Your Constitution modifier is +2.\n\n- **Roll:** 1d8 + 2\n- **Average:** 5 + 2 = 7\n\nWhich do you choose?"

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Great! Your roll matches the average, so your maximum hit points will increase by 7, bringing you to 28 max HP.\n\nNext, let's go over **new class features** you gain at Cleric level 3:\n\n1. **Channel Divinity (1/rest):** You already have this feature, but at 3rd level, you gain an additional way to use your Channel Divinity based on your Divine Domain. Since you are a Life Domain cleric, you already have \"Preserve Life,\" which you received at 2nd level.\n2. **3rd-level Clerics also gain access to 2nd-level spells.** You now have:\n    - Spell slots for 2nd-level spells (2 slots according to the cleric table).\n    - The ability to prepare and cast 2nd-level spells.\n\n**No new Channel Divinity options are granted at this level for Life Domain, but you do get more powerful spells.**\n\n**Now, let's move on to spellcasting:**\n- Your spell slots are now:\n    - 1st-level: 4 slots\n    - 2nd-level: 2 slots\n\nYou may now prepare and cast 2nd-level cleric spells. Your total number of prepared spells is now equal to your Cleric level + your Wisdom modifier (3 + 3 = 6). However, as a Life Domain Cleric, you always have \"Bless\" and \"Cure Wounds\" prepared.\n\n**Second-level cleric spells you can choose from include:**\n- Aid\n- Augury\n- Blindness/Deafness\n- Calm Emotions\n- Continual Flame\n- Enhance Ability\n- Find Traps\n- Gentle Repose\n- Hold Person\n- Lesser Restoration\n- Locate Object\n- Prayer of Healing\n- Protection from Poison\n- Silence\n- Spiritual Weapon\n- Warding Bond\n- Zone of Truth\n\nWould you like to prepare any 2nd-level spells? If so, which ones would you like to add to your prepared list? You may also update your 1st-level prepared spells if you wish."

  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Great question! As a Life Domain Cleric focused on both combat and support, here are some popular and effective 2nd-level cleric spells you might consider:\n\n**Combat/Adventuring Support Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Aid**  \n   - Increases the max and current HP of up to three creatures by 5 for 8 hours. This is a party-wide boost that helps everyone survive both combat and hazards.\n\n2. **Spiritual Weapon**  \n   - Bonus action to summon a floating weapon that attacks each round without concentration. It's a powerful, reliable damage option and doesn't require your main action after the initial cast.\n\n3. **Hold Person**  \n   - Paralyzes a humanoid target if they fail a Wisdom save. Great for neutralizing dangerous enemies and setting up big damage from your allies.\n\n4. **Lesser Restoration**  \n   - Cures one disease or condition (blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned). It's not always needed, but having it prepared can save the day in the right situation.\n\n5. **Prayer of Healing**  \n   - Heals up to six creatures for 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier, but takes 10 minutes to cast. Great after battles, especially when resources are stretched.\n\n6. **Warding Bond**  \n   - Buffs an ally's AC and saves, and splits damage they take with you. Fantastic if you want to protect a fragile party member, but you share the pain.\n\n**Most Common Choices for Life Clerics:**\n- **Aid** (synergizes with your healing bonus and is always useful)\n- **Spiritual Weapon** (gives you a strong bonus-action attack every round)\n\nWould you like to prepare **Aid** and **Spiritual Weapon**?  \nAlso, do you want to adjust your 1st-level prepared spells, or keep them as is? (You may prepare up to 6 spells now, not counting your always-prepared Bless and Cure Wounds.)"
