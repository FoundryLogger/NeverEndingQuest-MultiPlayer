Generate a single, richly detailed narrative paragraph that describes all factual events that occurred within the location 'Ambush Site', and only within that location. This is a retrospective summary, like a journal or chronicle--focused entirely on what actually happened, in clear chronological order.\n\nThe summary must be written in third person and past tense, and should read like a complete account of the party's time at that location. Include:\n- Descriptions of the environment and ambiance.\n- Character actions and reactions.\n- Discoveries made and information gained.\n- Consequences of actions and decisions.\n- Emotional dynamics between characters (tension, trust, affection, conflict).\n- Notable NPC interactions.\n- Any interpersonal developments (e.g., flirtation, bonding, solemn moments).\n\nYou may include brief direct quotes only when they are notable turning points, emotionally charged, or central to the scene's meaning--such as symbolic phrases like 'playing house' or promises made. Keep these minimal and impactful.\n\nDo NOT:\n- Include events from previous or future locations.\n- Speculate about the future or characters' intentions.\n- Use first-person narration or dialogue-heavy exchanges.\n- Use bullet points, headings, or formatting.\n- Include any JSON, schemas, or DM notes.\n- Editorialize or guess what characters were thinking beyond observable behavior.\n\nYour writing should feel immersive, literary, and grounded--like a historical entry capturing a poignant moment in time."

But the places where Wounded Scout Neris and Merchant Lira were last huddled are now empty--no sign of either figure remains.\\n\\nBootprints crisscross the muddy earth, some older, some fresher. You see where makeshift bedding was left and where drag marks lead out of the clearing, vanishing into the undergrowth toward the trail. It's clear that the prisoners are no longer here. Whether they recovered enough to flee, were moved by unseen hands, or have simply hidden themselves in safer cover, you cannot immediately know.\\n\\nThe Ambush Site is quiet, holding its breath for what comes next.

Will you search for further clues to the fate of the prisoners, push onward toward the Rangers' Outpost, or take a moment to rest and recover your own strength?\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 5\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPlayer: Dungeon Master Note: Current date and time: 1492 Springmonth 2 05:20:00.

Player: I take Kira back to see Elen at the command post\n\nDungeon Master: {\n  \"narration\": \"You gently adjust your grip, making sure Kira is as comfortable as you can manage, and steel yourself for the journey back through the dense forest. The Ambush Site, with its battered wagon and blood-stained earth, fades behind you as you step onto the narrow, winding trail that leads out of the Thornwood and toward the safety of the Rangers' Command Post.\\n\\nThe path is eerily quiet, the usual birdsong absent, broken only by the distant creak of wood and the thud of your boots on damp loam. Kira's breathing is shallow but steady as you press onward, determined to bring her to Elen and whatever healing aid or wisdom the commander can offer.\\n\\nAfter a tense trek through the undergrowth, the forest thins, and the wooden palisades of the outpost come into view, watched over by grim-faced rangers who quickly recognize your burden. They rush to open the gate and wave you through, urgency etched on every face as word spreads of your return.\\n\\nCommander Elen stands near the center of the bustling post, her sharp eyes widening at the sight of Kira's limp form. She rushes forward, barking orders for the healer and gesturing you to follow her into the main hall. The heat of the fire and the scent of wild thyme greet you inside as Elen kneels beside Kira, assessing her wounds with practiced concern. \\\"You did well, Eirik,\\\" she says, voice tight with worry. \\\"We will do all we can. Rest now--your work has not gone unnoticed.\\\"\\n\\nAs Kira is carried away for care, you are left with a moment to catch your breath, the weight of exhaustion settling into your bones. The pulse of the command post, the familiar smells, and the low murmur of voices bring a fragile sense of hope. For now, Kira is in good hands.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"transitionLocation\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"newLocation\": \"RO01\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 30\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updatePlot\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"plotPointId\": \"PP002\",\n        \"newStatus\": \"in progress\",\n        \"plotImpact\": \"Eirik returns to the Rangers' Command Post with the injured Kira, seeking medical attention and reporting the dire situation at the Ambush Site.
