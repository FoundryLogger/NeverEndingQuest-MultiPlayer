Generate a single, richly detailed narrative paragraph that describes all factual events that occurred within the location 'Trader's Rest', and only within that location. This is a retrospective summary, like a journal or chronicle--focused entirely on what actually happened, in clear chronological order.\n\nThe summary must be written in third person and past tense, and should read like a complete account of the party's time at that location. Include:\n- Descriptions of the environment and ambiance.\n- Character actions and reactions.\n- Discoveries made and information gained.\n- Consequences of actions and decisions.\n- Emotional dynamics between characters (tension, trust, affection, conflict).\n- Notable NPC interactions.\n- Any interpersonal developments (e.g., flirtation, bonding, solemn moments).\n\nYou may include brief direct quotes only when they are notable turning points, emotionally charged, or central to the scene's meaning--such as symbolic phrases like 'playing house' or promises made. Keep these minimal and impactful.\n\nDo NOT:\n- Include events from previous or future locations.\n- Speculate about the future or characters' intentions.\n- Use first-person narration or dialogue-heavy exchanges.\n- Use bullet points, headings, or formatting.\n- Include any JSON, schemas, or DM notes.\n- Editorialize or guess what characters were thinking beyond observable behavior.\n\nYour writing should feel immersive, literary, and grounded--like a historical entry capturing a poignant moment in time."
