The air outside the Wyrd Lantern Inn is fragrant with baking bread and woodsmoke. A brass lantern gleams above the painted green door as you step inside. The inn's familiar coziness embraces you: mismatched chairs cluster around the hearth, charms dangle from the beams, and the gentle glow of lanterns chases away all memory of shadow. Cira, the innkeeper, beams as she sees you both. \\\"Well, look who's wandered back from the woods! Come, sit, sit. I've a stew on the fire and a loaf just out of the oven. Harrow's Hollow owes you a feast, and I won't hear otherwise.\\\"\\n\\nElen grins shyly, fatigue softening her features. \\\"Thank you, Cira. I think we could both use a little warmth after all that's happened.\\\"\\n\\nVillagers lift their mugs in quiet salute as you take a seat by the fire. The promise of safety and fellowship hangs in the air, a balm for tired souls.

Luck... and something more.\\\"\\n\\nAs the stew is ladled out, you catch Elen watching the fire, her face soft with gratitude. \\\"Harrow's Hollow is safe again--for now.
