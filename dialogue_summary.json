The path twists through dense brambles, the only sounds your measured footsteps and the distant, anxious rustle of wings.

Keep your shield ready, and let's move quiet.'\\n\\nYou slip forward, the forest falling utterly silent behind you. Just ahead, through the tangled undergrowth, the outline of a crumbling stone tower looms in the night, firelight flickering in a few arrow slits and the faint sound of rough voices drifting from within.

The old watchtower's cracked stone walls rise above the brambles, flickering firelight leaking through narrow arrow slits. Somewhere within, rough voices murmur and laugh, oblivious to your silent approach.\\n\\nKira shifts beside you, her bowstring taut, eyes fixed on the battered doorway partially obscured by brush. 'This is it, Eirik,' she whispers. 'If we want to slip in unnoticed, now's our chance. Or we can wait, see if any patrols return, or even try to draw someone out. What do you think?'\\n\\nThe Thornwood behind you is a sea of darkness and secrets, but every sense tells you this is the enemy's heart. The next move is yours.

'There's the palisade gate with those heavy crossbeams,' she whispers, gesturing subtly. 'Looks solid--locked, most likely, and no telling how many are stationed behind it.'\\n\\nShe leans closer, voice low. 'But look there, Eirik--see that section where the wall meets the old oak? Some of the logs are cracked, and the ground looks softer. Might be a weak point if we want to try climbing or prying our way in, but it's right in sight of one of those lookout posts. If we go for stealth, we'll have to be careful not to get spotted by the sentries.'\\n\\nHer eyes flick to the darkened approach, where the shadows are thickest. 'We could work our way around behind the brambles, look for a hidden way in, or even try to cause a distraction. Or I could try to get up a tree and pick off a sentry when no one's looking. What do you think? Risk a climb, try to draw them out, or check for a hidden entrance?'\\n\\nShe pauses, frowning with concern. 'Just... watch your step. If there's going to be a pit trap, it'll be right along the main approach. Nothing like a few sharpened stakes to spoil our night.'\\n\\nWhat do you want to do, Eirik?

Her keen eyes dart from one lookout post to the next as she studies the fortifications.\\n\\n'I'd wager at least six,' she whispers, voice barely above the rustle of leaves. 'There's always a pair of sentries up in those trees, and I've seen three or four more moving near the fire pit and the main gate. But that big half-orc in armor--the one with the glowing eyes? He's their captain, and he won't be an easy mark.'\\n\\nShe glances sidelong at you, her confidence tinged with tension. 'If they've got more inside the tower, we might be talking seven or eight, but most look like they're hunkered down around the fire or patrolling the walls. We definitely can't take them all at once. If we move careful and pick off a sentry, we might slip in and cause a distraction, but if they raise the alarm, we'll have the whole nest on us.'\\n\\nKira pauses, then points to the path near the gate. 'That patch of ground looks off--sunken a bit, no leaves. Classic spot for a pit trap. I'd bet silver there's one waiting for us right by the main approach.'\\n\\nShe looks to you expectantly.

A little chaos in the night might give us the edge.'\\n\\nShe crouches low, scanning the stronghold's perimeter for sentries, her eyes flickering between the lookout posts and the main fire pit beyond the wall. 'We could use the darkness to our advantage. Maybe shoot an arrow to spook the horses, light up some supplies, or mimic an animal call to lure a sentry out. If we make them think something's wrong beyond the walls, one or two might come to investigate, and that's when we strike.'\\n\\nKira glances back at you for affirmation. 'I can handle the bow work, but you might want to ready a spell just in case things go loud. When you're set, I'll pick my moment and let fly. Let's make them nervous.'\\n\\nShe settles into position behind a fallen log, nocking an arrow and waiting for your signal. The torches flicker in the distance, and the sounds of banter carry on the night air. All that's needed now is the first move.\\n\\nEirik, how do you want to draw them out? A distraction, a whispered call, or perhaps a torch tossed into their supplies?

'All right, let's see if we can peel one away from their post.'\\n\\nShe slips silently through the undergrowth to get a clear line of sight on the nearest lookout, an arrow nocked and ready. You prepare yourself, flattening behind a tangle of brambles as you scan for any sign that your plan has been noticed. Kira draws a smooth breath, then imitates the sharp, urgent bark of a fox from the darkness--a call perfectly suited to the Thornwood but unusual enough to catch the bandits' attention.\\n\\nMoments later, a torch flares at the edge of the palisade. One of the sentries peers out, muttering a curse as he steps closer to the wall, searching the darkness. He calls over his shoulder, 'Probably them damn animals again... I'll check it out.'\\n\\nThe sentry climbs down from the lookout post and slips through a narrow service gate, his crossbow at the ready as he steps into the brush, squinting in your direction. He's alone, separated from the others by the wall. Kira gives you a sharp nod, her eyes asking if you want her to take the shot now or if you want to try something else.\\n\\nEirik, do you want Kira to loose her arrow as soon as the sentry is clear, or would you rather try to subdue him quietly?

If I strike from the shadows, I can land a sneak attack--it lets me drive the point home where it hurts most. If he doesn't know I'm here, that first shot will sting twice as bad.'\\n\\nHer fingers tighten on the bowstring, voice barely audible. 'I can slip past most folk without a sound, and if he gets close, I can use my Cunning Action to duck away or get behind him before he can shout.'\\n\\nShe gives you a quick, reassuring smirk, confidence gleaming in her green eyes. 'Just help me keep him off balance, and I'll make it quick and quiet. If you want to take him alive, let me know--otherwise, I'll aim to drop him before he can call for help.'\\n\\nThe sentry pauses, peering warily at the shadows. Now is the moment to decide, Eirik: do you want Kira to take the shot and use her sneak attack, or do you want to try to capture the sentry for information?

The sentry, unaware of the danger stalking him, edges closer to the brush in search of the source of the fox's call. His crossbow is raised, but his attention is scattered, his posture betraying a hint of boredom.\\n\\nWith the sentry alone and out of sight of the main stronghold, Kira takes a slow, measured breath. You catch the subtle glint of determination in her eyes. She looses her arrow, aiming for the vital spot behind the bandit's collarbone, using her rogue training to strike with deadly precision while unseen.\\n\\nLet's resolve Kira's attack: She rolls with advantage thanks to her stealth and the sentry's lack of awareness.\\n\\nKira's attack roll: d20 (15) and d20 (10), taking the higher result: 15. With her +5 attack bonus, that's a total of 20--a solid hit! Her sneak attack damage: 1d6 (bow) + 1d6 (sneak attack) = 3 + 4 = 7. Add her Dexterity modifier (+3), for a total of 10 piercing damage.\\n\\nThe arrow thuds home with a muffled grunt. The sentry staggers, clutching his side, barely remaining upright but clearly gravely wounded, his crossbow falling into the brush. He gasps for breath, panic flaring in his eyes, but he's still on his feet--for now.\\n\\nEirik, you see the sentry start to lurch back toward the gate, his voice catching in his throat as he tries to call out.

Her sharp eyes spot another sentry--a burly figure silhouetted on a raised platform just above the palisade, idly scanning the dark, his crossbow resting on the rail. He hasn't noticed that his companion is missing yet, and doesn't look especially alert, but a wrong move could draw his gaze.\\n\\nKira returns and murmurs, 'The second sentry's above the gate, watching the path.

The night's tension doesn't quite fade, but the sense of accomplishment strengthens your resolve for the challenges ahead.\\n\\nAs you press on, the second sentry remains at his post above the gate, oblivious to the fate of his comrade.
