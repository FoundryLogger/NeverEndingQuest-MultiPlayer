Generate a single, richly detailed narrative paragraph that describes all factual events that occurred within the location 'Ambush Site', and only within that location. This is a retrospective summary, like a journal or chronicle--focused entirely on what actually happened, in clear chronological order.\n\nThe summary must be written in third person and past tense, and should read like a complete account of the party's time at that location. Include:\n- Descriptions of the environment and ambiance.\n- Character actions and reactions.\n- Discoveries made and information gained.\n- Consequences of actions and decisions.\n- Emotional dynamics between characters (tension, trust, affection, conflict).\n- Notable NPC interactions.\n- Any interpersonal developments (e.g., flirtation, bonding, solemn moments).\n\nYou may include brief direct quotes only when they are notable turning points, emotionally charged, or central to the scene's meaning--such as symbolic phrases like 'playing house' or promises made. Keep these minimal and impactful.\n\nDo NOT:\n- Include events from previous or future locations.\n- Speculate about the future or characters' intentions.\n- Use first-person narration or dialogue-heavy exchanges.\n- Use bullet points, headings, or formatting.\n- Include any JSON, schemas, or DM notes.\n- Editorialize or guess what characters were thinking beyond observable behavior.\n\nYour writing should feel immersive, literary, and grounded--like a historical entry capturing a poignant moment in time."

'Back to the scene of the crime, then? I've got your back, Eirik.' She gives you a reassuring wink as you both step out from the safety of the command post into the afternoon light.\\n\\nThe rangers at the palisade nod you through with a mixture of respect and hope, and soon the familiar scents of pine and earth fill your senses. The wilds feel tense but awake, every sound sharper now that you walk with renewed strength and purpose.\\n\\nYou follow the winding trail, retracing the steps that led you through danger before. Your boots crunch in the undergrowth, and for a moment, the memory of past battles stirs beneath the hush of the woods. Kira keeps pace beside you, quiet but alert, scanning for signs of movement as the shadows lengthen.\\n\\nGradually, the trees thin and the battered clearing of the Ambush Site comes into view: overturned wagon, scattered arrows, and the telltale marks of your previous conflict--silent witnesses to the violence that transpired.\\n\\nKira surveys the area with narrowed eyes, her voice hushed. 'Let's see if the bandits left anything behind, or if something's changed while we were gone.'\\n\\nWhat do you do as you arrive? Search the site, check for new tracks, or prepare for a possible encounter?\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"transitionLocation\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"newLocation\": \"TW01\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateTime\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"timeEstimate\": 20\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPlayer: Dungeon Master Note: Current date and time: 1492 Springmonth 2 17:40:00. Player: We give the site one last thourough search\n\nDungeon Master: {\n  \"narration\": \"Kira crouches low beside a splintered wagon wheel, her eyes sharp as she scans the churned mud and scattered debris. 'Let's be thorough,' she murmurs, brushing aside brittle twigs. 'Bandits are cunning, and sometimes the forest hides more than tracks.'\\n\\nYou move together through the clearing, checking behind the upturned wagon, through spilled packs, and in the deep grooves left by wagon wheels. The air feels dense, heavy with the memory of violence, and the dimming light casts long shadows over each broken arrow and torn scrap of cloth.\\n\\nPlease make an Investigation check. Roll a d20 and add your Investigation modifier. \\n\\nAs you search, Kira also starts methodically sifting through the leaf litter and broken branches.

There's something to be said for a soldier's eye.'\\n\\nYou sift through the mud and tangled grass near the overturned wagon, fingers brushing against a patch of earth that feels oddly loose. Digging deeper, you uncover a broken bandit dagger, its hilt engraved with Malarok's twisted sigil. Not far away, a sealed bandage packet and a handful of trail rations are tucked beneath an upturned crate--likely overlooked in the chaos. Among scattered merchant goods, you spot a torn but valuable scrap of cloth--perhaps a clue to the fate of the missing captives.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kira kneels by the wagon's axle, her sharp eyes finding a stray crossbow bolt and a small pouch that jingles with a few silver coins. She holds them up, grinning. 'Bandits really ought to tidy up after themselves.'\\n\\nAs the last rays of sunlight slant across the clearing, the evidence you have gathered offers a clearer sense of the bandits' passage: drag marks head toward the Bandit Trail, mixed with bootprints both large and small. The sense of urgency lingers, but for now, your search has yielded both supplies and clues--tokens that may help you piece together the events that unfolded here.\\n\\nWhat would you like to do next?
