The anxiety and weariness of the past days linger in their eyes, but hope glimmers there now. Elen stands a little behind you, her clothes torn and face smeared with the ordeal, but she meets the villagers' gaze with a quiet steadiness.\\n\\nYou raise your voice, recounting Elen's courage--how she risked everything to face the darkness first, lighting the way through cursed shadows and never giving in to despair. You tell of her desperate fight to restore the wards, her unyielding hope that someone would come for her, and how, in the end, it was her bravery and knowledge that guided you both back to safety. \\\"Elen is the true hero of Harrow's Hollow,\\\" you declare. \\\"It was her spirit and sacrifice that broke the curse.\\\"\\n\\nThere is a long pause as your words settle over the crowd. Then, one by one, villagers begin to clap--hesitantly at first, then with growing fervor. Elder Mirna steps forward, eyes shining with gratitude. \\\"Scout Elen,\\\" she says, her voice carrying through the hushed square, \\\"your memory and courage will never be forgotten. Harrow's Hollow is safe again because of you both.\\\"\\n\\nElen blushes fiercely, ducking her head. \\\"I only did what had to be done,\\\" she says quietly, but the crowd surges forward to embrace her, offering thanks, tears, and laughter. Children tug at her sleeves, and neighbors press gifts of bread, apples, and knitted scarves into her arms. The air fills with relief and celebration.\\n\\nElder Mirna turns to you, Norn, her expression serious but kind. \\\"Your part in this is no less vital. Come, let us speak inside. The village owes you both a debt we can never truly repay.\\\"\\n\\nAs the crowd celebrates Elen, you sense a shift in the air--the bitter fear of the past days replaced by genuine hope, and the promise of new beginnings.\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updatePlot\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"plotPointId\": \"PP001\",\n        \"newStatus\": \"completed\",\n        \"plotImpact\": \"Norn publicly credits Elen for her heroism, inspiring the village to celebrate her bravery and marking a new era of hope for Harrow's Hollow.

We'll be here when you're ready to return. The village is safe, and for once, we have time to breathe.\\\"\\n\\nThe sunlight seems warmer, the air easier, as you take your leave with the knowledge that Harrow's Hollow is secure, for now.

Elder Mirna, noticing your return, gives you a warm nod and gestures for you to join her near the guardhouse.\\n\\nAs you make your way through the gathering, familiar faces smile and offer greetings, some with bread or fruit pressed into your hands in thanks. The oppressive fear that once haunted the village has vanished, replaced by a sense of renewal and cautious optimism. Elen catches your eye and offers a genuine, grateful smile.\\n\\nElder Mirna beckons you closer. \\\"Norn, when you are ready, I would speak with you and Elen about what comes next. The village owes you both more than words, but perhaps we can begin to repay the debt.

The village owes you more than a single day of feasting. Still, there are matters to discuss--and perhaps more tales to share by the fire tonight.\\\"\\n\\nThe villagers continue to express their gratitude--pressing bread, apples, and tokens of thanks into your hands and Elen's. The sense of relief and hope is palpable, and the square feels brighter with every passing moment. Yet you sense the next chapter is about to begin: rewards earned, new responsibilities, and the lingering possibility of further adventures.\\n\\nElen looks at you, her expression growing more serious. \\\"Come on, Norn.

I'd be just as happy for a quiet moment and a soft chair. Still, it's good to see everyone smiling again.\\\"\\n\\nElder Mirna, overhearing, chuckles. \\\"Let the village have its joy, Elen. You and Norn have earned a break from the spotlight. But take your time--when you're both ready, join me at the guardhouse. There are rewards and plans to discuss, and the future of Harrow's Hollow to consider.\\\"\\n\\nThe festivities continue around you, but both Elen and the elder seem content to wait at your pace.

She obliges, crouching down and recounting her journey in a voice that is steady and warm, her confidence returning as she sees the villagers' admiration. She catches your eye between tales and gives you a nod of gratitude--this moment, these smiles, belong to both of you.\\n\\nElder Mirna moves through the crowd, exchanging quiet words with the townsfolk, but she does not hurry you. Instead, she finds a seat on the edge of the stone fountain, content to let the village have its heroes for just a little longer.

A group of young men raise a toast in your honor, while several women press tokens of thanks into your hands--a lucky coin, a charm against bad dreams, a ribbon in dawn-blue. Elen, flush with happiness and not a little embarrassment, laughs along with their stories, her voice clear and strong for the first time in days.
