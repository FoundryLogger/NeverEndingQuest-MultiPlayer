**AI-Generated Chronicle**:

The day’s light dwindled as the party departed the battered general store of Harrow’s Hollow, bleak shadow pooling beneath the eaves. Within, they had bartered words and wary trust with Old Mags, keeper of the store’s secrets, whose rheumy gaze lingered on their weapons and wounds. A hush had fallen over the town, as if the land itself anticipated blood.
