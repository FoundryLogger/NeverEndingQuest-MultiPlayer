      "game_output": "You stand in the Harrow's Hollow General Store, the familiar aroma of dried herbs and leather mingling in the cool morning air. The overcast sky beyond the window casts a grey pall over the shelves of goods. The store is quiet, with only the faint creak of floorboards as you shift your weight--a rare moment of calm after your harrowing journey through the Gloamwood.\n\nAs you take stock of your gear and catch your breath, memories of the night's supernatural trials flicker at the edge of your thoughts: the damp forest gloom, the renewed protective ward, and the promise of answers at the Keeper's Cottage. Though the village remains tense, the knowledge that you have temporarily weakened the keep's curse brings a measure of relief.\n\nOutside, the square stirs softly as villagers begin their day, wary but hopeful in the wake of your deeds. The path ahead is uncertain, but you have gained the trust of Elder Mirna and the thanks of those you've saved--at least for now.\n\nWhat will you do, Norn? Will you check your supplies, visit another part of the village, or seek out news about Scout Elen and the Keeper? The morning is yours, and the investigation into the fate of Harrow's Hollow stands at a crossroads.",
      "ai_action": "I will immediately seek out Elder Mirna to get the main quest, as per my testing profile's highest priority to discover the quest from the quest-giving NPC. I will leave the general store and head directly to Elder Mirna's location in the village square or nearby, asking any NPCs on the way for directions if needed, using keywords like \"quest,\" \"task,\" or \"problem.\" I will avoid checking supplies or side content for now to focus on main quest discovery.",

The morning air in Harrow's Hollow is brisk and tinged with nervous energy, but you sense the villagers' mood has shifted--your deeds in the wilds have not gone unnoticed.\n\nCrossing the narrow lane, you stride purposefully toward the Town Square, the heart of the village. A few early risers tend to chores or cluster in quiet conversation, glancing your way with growing hope. Near the center, beneath the branches of the old hanging elm, you spot Elder Mirna Harrow--her silver hair gathered neatly, her cloak drawn close against the morning chill. She speaks in low tones with a pair of townsfolk, their anxious faces softening at your approach.\n\nAs you near, Mirna turns and offers you a warm, grateful smile. \"Ah, Norn,\" she says, her voice steady but laced with exhaustion. \"Word of your actions has already begun to ease troubled hearts. Please, join me. There are matters we must discuss--about the curse, the missing, and the future of this village.\"\n\nShe gestures for you to walk alongside her as the villagers respectfully step back. \"You have questions, I am sure. And I have answers--though some come with new burdens. Tell me, Norn, are you ready to hear what task awaits, now that the shadows have lifted--if only for a time?\"\n\nThe square is yours. Will you press Elder Mirna for details about your next quest, ask after the missing, or inquire about your hard-won rewards? Others in the square cast hopeful glances, eager to see what the hero of Harrow's Hollow will do.",

As you sit, the villagers at the edge of the square watch in respectful silence, eager for what comes next.\n\n\"Your bravery has brought us hope, Norn,\" she begins, her voice carrying to those gathered. \"The ritual you performed at the Lost Ward Circle has weakened the keep's grip. Still, the darkness at the heart of the Keep of Doom remains unbroken. The curse is not yet fully lifted. And as for the missing--Scout Elen among them--their fates are entwined with the secrets sealed within those walls.\"\n\nShe produces a battered bronze key from her cloak, pressing it into your palm with solemn care. \"This belonged to our last guardian. It may open the way into the keep or unlock a chamber within. Your next task is clear: travel to the Keep of Doom. Find the source of the corruption--the vengeful spirit of Lord Thaddeus Greymont. Whether by blade, ritual, or compassion, end his torment and break the curse upon these lands.\"\n\nMirna leans closer, her tone hushed. \"Scout Elen may yet live, held captive by the keep's restless spirits. Free any you find. Beware the wards and traps--the keep twists the minds of intruders. If you can, return alive, and our gratitude will be boundless. The villagers will rally behind you, and I will see to it you are rewarded both in gold and in kinship.\"\n\nShe stands, addressing the square, \"Let it be known: Norn has accepted the hero's charge. The future of Harrow's Hollow rests upon your shoulders.\"\n\nThe villagers break into relieved applause. A few step forward to offer small tokens--fresh bread, a lucky coin, a simple blessing. Mirna's expression softens. \"Go when you are ready, champion. May the wards you renewed protect you on the road to Doom.\"\n\nYou now possess the bronze key and clear quest instructions. If you have any questions about the keep, Lord Greymont, or the missing, Mirna remains at your side, ready to answer.",

Lord Greymont's spirit is bound there by regret and rage. To break the curse, you must either grant him the peace he was denied in life, or drive him from this world with steel and will.\"\n\nShe presses a weathered parchment into your hands--a hastily sketched map of the keep's outer grounds. \"This may help you find a safer path in. Beware: the wards are weakest on the east side, near the old chapel. If you seek the missing, start there. Listen for the voices of the dead; sometimes, they wish to be heard.\"\n\nA young villager, eyes wide and hands trembling, approaches. \"Sir Norn, my brother disappeared near the crypts beneath the keep.

The wards there are weakest, but caution is warranted--the land itself feels twisted, and even the trees lean away.\"\n\nShe lowers her voice, her gaze flickering with unease. \"As for traps: the keep's outer doors are often warded with glyphs that trigger ghostly alarms or bursts of cold. Some villagers say the stones themselves can sap your strength if you linger in shadow too long. If you are able, bring a lantern or some blessed token--light and faith have power against the curse.\"\n\nAt the mention of Lord Greymont, Mirna's expression turns grave. \"He was once a just man, but grief--then dark magic--twisted him. They say his spirit cannot bear to see tokens of his lost love, Lady Isolde. If you come across something belonging to her--a locket, a ribbon--it may weaken his anger.
