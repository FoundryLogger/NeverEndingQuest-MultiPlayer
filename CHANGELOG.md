## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-17

### Added
- New `generate_prerolls.py` module that pre-generates dice rolls for all combat actions, preventing the LLM from deciding roll outcomes
- Explicit character type labeling in combat (PLAYER, NPC, ENEMY) for clearer differentiation
- Import for `generate_prerolls` function in `combat_manager.py`
- Preroll text generation before each combat round with:
  - Attack rolls
  - Damage rolls (using proper damage dice from creature stats)
  - Saving throw rolls
  - Ability check rolls
  - Clear labeling of creature types and relationships

### Changed
- Combat AI no longer determines dice roll outcomes - all rolls are pre-generated
- Enhanced creature type identification with explicit labels:
  - PLAYER CHARACTER: Controlled by the human player
  - NPC: Friendly non-player character allied with the player
  - ENEMY: Hostile monster fighting against the player
- Updated combat prompts to include pre-generated rolls for each round

### Improved
- Fairness of combat by removing AI bias in dice rolling
- Transparency of combat mechanics with explicit pre-rolled values
- Clarity of character roles and allegiances in combat encounters

### Fixed
- Previously fixed XP calculation path issue for monster files
- Previously fixed .gitignore to exclude runtime and debug files
