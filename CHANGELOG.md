## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-17

### Fixed
- Web interface output routing to properly separate game narration and debug information
- Only "Dungeon Master:" messages appear in the game output panel
- All other output (DEBUG, ERROR, system messages, etc.) now goes to the debug panel
- Fixed issue where DM dialogue containing quotes or colons was incorrectly split between panels
- Improved detection of player status lines vs. DM content to prevent incorrect panel routing

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added
- New `generate_prerolls.py` module that pre-generates dice rolls for all combat actions, preventing the LLM from deciding roll outcomes
- Explicit character type labeling in combat (PLAYER, NPC, ENEMY) for clearer differentiation
- Import for `generate_prerolls` function in `combat_manager.py`
- Preroll text generation before each combat round with:
  - Attack rolls
  - Damage rolls (using proper damage dice from creature stats)
  - Saving throw rolls
  - Ability check rolls
  - Clear labeling of creature types and relationships
- Web-based interface for the game with Flask and SocketIO:
  - Separate panels for game output and debug information
  - Real-time updates using WebSockets
  - Automatic browser launch when starting the game
  - Professional dark theme UI
  - Input handling through web interface
- `web_interface.py` - Flask server with SocketIO for real-time communication
- `templates/game_interface.html` - Modern web UI with split panel design
- `run_web.py` - Simple launcher script that starts the web interface

### Changed
- Combat AI no longer determines dice roll outcomes - all rolls are pre-generated
- Enhanced creature type identification with explicit labels:
  - PLAYER CHARACTER: Controlled by the human player
  - NPC: Friendly non-player character allied with the player
  - ENEMY: Hostile monster fighting against the player
- Updated combat prompts to include pre-generated rolls for each round
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include Flask and SocketIO dependencies

### Improved
- Fairness of combat by removing AI bias in dice rolling
- Transparency of combat mechanics with explicit pre-rolled values
- Clarity of character roles and allegiances in combat encounters
- User experience with a modern web interface instead of terminal-only output

### Fixed
- Previously fixed XP calculation path issue for monster files
- Previously fixed .gitignore to exclude runtime and debug files
