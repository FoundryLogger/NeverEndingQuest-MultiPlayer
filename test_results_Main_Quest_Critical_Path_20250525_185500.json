The patrol markers glint with dew, and the air is heavy with damp earth and a lingering hint of campfire smoke--fresher than the old ashes would suggest.\n\nWith a careful search, you uncover several notable clues: a set of muddy bootprints leading out toward the forest's edge, a recently extinguished campfire with half-burned ward sigils drawn in charcoal on the stones, and a crumpled parchment tucked beneath an overturned bunk. Unfolding the parchment, you find a rough, hand-drawn map of the local woods. The map marks the Lost Ward Circle and a route spiraling deeper into the Gloamwood--toward the Keeper's domain. Scrawled in the margin is a warning: 'Trust not the lights. The Keeper knows. Mark your path.'\n\nYou sense you are not alone in this forest--someone or something has been using the outpost as a waypoint, and the Keeper's presence draws ever nearer.

These practical gifts of a lost patrol may prove invaluable deeper in the Gloamwood.\n\nSettling by the ancient ward stones, you open the weathered journal and leaf through its mud-spattered pages.
