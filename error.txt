DEBUG: Combat response validation failed. Reason: The response is only a scene description and initiative order, which is appropriate for the player input. However, since no combat actions have occurred yet, there are no HP changes, deaths, or exit actions to validate. The initiative order in the narration is incorrect: Elara should act first (initiative 20), then the Giant Centipede (17), then Norn (15), and finally Gilly and Thalor (both at 2). The narration says Elara acts first, which is correct, but then says the Giant Centipede is next, followed by Norn, which is also correct. However, it does not clarify the tie between Gilly and Thalor at initiative 2. This is a minor omission, but overall, the narration matches the encounter state and no combat flow errors are present. Since this is a scene-setting response, the validation is not strictly applicable yet, but for completeness, the initiative tie could be clarified.

Dungeon Master: From a crack in the stone floor near the ancient dwarven door, a Giant Centipede bursts forth, its many legs skittering rapidly and mandibles clicking aggressively. The air is tense as your party prepares for battle in the dark confines of the Hidden Entrance to the Dwarven Complex. The initiative order for this encounter is clear: Elara strikes first with her keen elven reflexes, followed by the Giant Centipede's swift movement. Then you, Norn, ready your weapon to face the creature head-on. Bringing up the rear are your companions Gilly and Thalor, both tied on initiative but with Gilly poised to act before Thalor this round due to her nimble agility. Elara glances at you with determination and says, "Stay sharp, Norn. We need to take this quick—it’s small but dangerous."

Dungeon Master: You swiftly notch an arrow to your sturdy bow and let it fly towards the Giant Centipede. Rolling your attack roll, you get an 18 on the d20 plus your +4 attack bonus, totaling 22. That easily hits the centipede's AC of 13!

For damage, you roll 1d6 for your bow plus 2 from your Dexterity modifier, dealing 5 piercing damage. The arrow strikes true, piercing through the creature's chitinous armor. The Giant Centipede collapses to the ground, its many legs twitching briefly before stilling—it is dead.
