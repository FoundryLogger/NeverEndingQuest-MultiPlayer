The musty scent of oiled leather mingles with the aroma of dried herbs hanging in bundles over the counter. A bell above the door chimes as you shift your weight, the only sound in the otherwise quiet shop.\n\nIt's early yet, and the store feels calm, almost expectant. Outside, through the fogged glass, you catch glimpses of the overcast village streets--the people of Harrow's Hollow beginning their day, wary but determined, moving in small clusters for safety. The events of the last days--vanished neighbors, rumors of curses, your own recent challenges in the haunted Gloamwood--linger in the air like an unspoken warning.\n\nThe storekeeper is nowhere in sight at the moment, but you hear faint shuffling from the back room. The counter is cluttered with a ledger, a stub of a candle, and a small wooden box, its lid slightly ajar.

She carries herself with the brisk efficiency of someone accustomed to running a tight ship, even as worry lines her face.\n\n\"A quest, you say?\" She sets a crate on the counter and gives you a once-over, sizing you up with a merchant's practiced eye. \"Well, that's not something most folk are asking for these days, what with the shadows lifting and the keep's curse broken. Still, there's always work for those willing.\"\n\nShe leans in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. \"Truth is, the village is in need of rebuilding--supplies have run low, and some trade wagons are overdue. If you're wanting to help, you might check with Elder Mirna in the Town Square; she'll be organizing efforts to restore the village and might have tasks fit for a hero.\"\n\nMarna glances at her ledger, then back at you. \"That said, if you're after coin or favor, there's talk of unclaimed rewards for those who aided in ending the curse.

Earning their trust, lending a hand, even helping with small troubles, will go a long way in these uncertain times.\" She gestures toward the Town Square, her tone softening. \"Mirna'll be there by now, I suspect. Or, if you want a simple task, I could use someone to help restock the storeroom and fetch a crate from the inn's cellar--if your hero's hands don't mind a bit of honest work.\"\n\nYou hear the faint bustle of the village outside, the day beginning to stir.

You seek a quest, a task, a mission?\" She smiles a little, the lines at her eyes deepening. \"Trust is earned twice in these times: once in battle, and once in rebuilding.\"\n\nShe gestures to the bustle around her. \"We need hands for everything--guarding the next trade caravan, helping repair the palisade, seeing to the wounded, even heading back to the keep for anything left behind. If you wish for more than honest labor, there are rumors of strange lights near the old graveyard after dusk, and... there is the matter of the Black Banner mercenaries, still camped near the keep, looting what they can. Each problem is a test and a chance to earn the village's lasting gratitude.\"\n\nMirna waits for your answer, her expression earnest. \"Tell me, Norn: what calls to you most?

      "content": "You set your sights on The Wyrd Lantern Inn, recalling Old Marna's instructions and the bustling warmth that always seems to emanate from its hearth. Passing through the East Gate and back into the village proper, you follow the well-trodden lane past the general store, the sounds of daily life growing richer around you. The inn rises at the far corner of the square, its painted sign swaying gently in the afternoon breeze--a beacon of comfort and stories.\n\nInside, the common room is lively with the clatter of mugs and low laughter. Behind the bar stands Cira, the innkeeper, a stout woman with a quick smile and flour still dusted on her sleeves. She glances up as you enter, wiping her hands on her apron and calling out, \"Norn! Marna sent word you'd be by. Looking for that crate in the cellar, are you? I can show you down, though mind the steps--it's a bit dim with the lantern out.\"\n\nCira gestures you behind the bar and toward a narrow door at the back. The scent of earth and old wood rises as she unlocks it, leading you down a creaking set of stairs into the cool gloom of the inn's cellar. Stacks of kegs, sacks of flour, and the promised crate for Marna await in the corner--though you notice a few scattered rat droppings and hear faint scurrying from deeper in the shadows.\n\nCira hands you a battered lantern. \"Here you go, love. Light this, and you should be able to find the crate easy enough. Holler if you need a hand with the rats--they've been bold lately.\"\n\nWith the lantern in hand and the crate in sight, you stand in the cellar, prepared to complete Marna's errand. What do you do next?"

With careful fingers, you run along the seams and inspect the lower plinth, your efforts rewarded by the faint click of a concealed compartment. Gently prying it open, you discover a small velvet pouch nestled within the hollow.\n\nInside the pouch lies a tarnished silver pendant, its surface etched with a spiral motif--strangely cold to the touch. The sight of it stirs a vague sense of unease, as if the pendant carries a forgotten story or hidden power. For the moment, it remains untouched in its pouch, awaiting your decision.\n\nDo you wish to take the pendant, leave it in place, or examine it further before making your choice?"
