She gives a small, practiced smile, but you sense a flicker of discomfort behind it.\n\n\"Ah, that old thing? Just a trinket, really. Been in the store for years. Folk say it belonged to one of the old families, but nobody's claimed it in a generation. Some think it opens a cellar or a lockbox lost to time. I reckon it's just another relic of the Hollow's past.\"\n\nYet her gaze lingers on you, and there's a subtle tension in her posture--a hesitation, as if she's holding something back.\n\nIf you want to discern whether Elder Mirna is telling you the whole truth about the key, please make an Insight check. Roll a d20 and add your Insight modifier."

She sets the ledger aside, folds her hands atop the counter, and leans forward conspiratorially, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"You've sharp eyes, Norn,\" she says, the formality slipping away from her tone. \"That key does have a history, though not one I share lightly. The raven sigil belonged to House Greymont, the old lords of the keep before... well, before darkness claimed it. My family has watched over the Hollow for generations. When the Greymonts fell, the survivors left relics--keys to places best left undisturbed.\"\n\nShe glances around to ensure no others are listening and continues, \"Some say the key opens a path into the keep itself, or perhaps a vault beneath it. I never had the courage to try, nor would I send someone unprepared. But you, after all you've done for us... perhaps you're meant to have it.\"\n\nMirna hesitates, eyes searching your face for resolve. \"If you truly mean to press on against the curse, then take the key, with my blessing and my warning: House Greymont's secrets are like old wounds--disturbed, they bleed anew.\"\n\nShe slides the cold bronze key across the counter toward you, its weight more than just metal in your palm.\n\n\"May you find answers where my courage failed,\" she finishes quietly. \"And may the Hollow never have cause to regret it.\"\n\nYou have gained the 'Old bronze key marked with a faded raven sigil'."

With your practiced intuition, you notice subtle signs--a tremor at the edge of her voice, the way her hand lingers over the counter as if longing to hold the key back, a shadow flickering behind her eyes.\n\nShe's telling the truth, but there's more beneath the surface: a deep, personal fear and a sense of guilt. You sense that giving you the key is not merely a practical gesture--it feels like the passing of a burden. Mirna is relieved to entrust it to you, but also deeply anxious about what darkness you might awaken by using it. This is not just a relic, but a symbol of old promises and mistakes the village would rather forget.\n\nShe meets your gaze, and for a moment, the weight of history passes silently between you. \"Take care, Norn. Some doors open both ways,\" she murmurs, her meaning clear."

There are five key places in Harrow's Hollow--each with its own folk, troubles, and secrets:\n\nFirst, you're standing in the General Store, the heart of the village's trade--anything worth bartering or learning sooner or later passes through here.\n\nTo the east, you'll find the Town Square--folk gather there for news, market days, and the odd announcement from myself or the militia.\n\nThe Militia Barracks waits just to the south, where our defenders train and take their ease. Captain Jasp keeps a close eye on any strangers.\n\nIf you head north, you'll reach the East Gate and Guardhouse, the main point of entry and our last line of defense. It's where travelers and trouble come and go.\n\nAnd to the west, The Wyrd Lantern Inn--a place for a hot meal, a warm bed, and gossip aplenty, should you have coin or patience for it.\n\nEach place has its own stories, and most folk will be glad of a friendly face--especially after all we've endured. Where will you begin your rounds, Norn? Or do you seek something particular in one of these places?\""
