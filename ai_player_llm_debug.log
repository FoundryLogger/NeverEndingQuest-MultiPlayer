Shelves groan beneath the weight of dried goods, lanterns, and bundles of rope--each item a silent witness to the town's worries and the rumors swirling in the spring air. The subtle scent of wax and leather lingers, overlaid by the sharper tang of ink from a cluttered ledger on the counter.\n\nBehind that counter stands Elder Mirna Harrow, her posture straight but her eyes betraying a hint of fatigue. She pauses in her bookkeeping, glances up, and offers you a practiced but genuine nod. 'Norn,' she greets, her voice quietly firm. 'Come for supplies? Or perhaps... other matters?'\n\nNear the entrance, the notice board bristles with hand-penned notes--some offering coin for lost livestock, others warning of strange happenings by moonlight. Stashed beneath the glass counter, you spot a weathered bronze key marked with a faded raven sigil, its presence almost intentionally out of sight.\n\nMirna's gaze momentarily flickers to the key before returning to you, her lips pressed into a thin line. You sense there's more to her words--and to the relic--than she's letting on.\n\nWhat would you like to do? You could gather supplies, inquire about the key or recent events, or perhaps take a closer look at the notice board. The air is heavy with unspoken stories, and time presses on as the village waits for answers."

The store grows quieter, the only sounds the distant clatter of a cart outside and the slow ticking of the wall clock.\n\n\"You have a soldier's eye, Norn,\" she finally says, voice low enough that only you can hear. \"Most folk overlook old things, but not those who've seen what secrets can cost.\"\n\nShe draws the bronze key into the light with care, its faded raven sigil glinting dully. \"This belonged to the Greymont family--the ones who built the keep before darkness took root there. It was given to me by my grandmother, who said it was best kept out of sight, lest it call trouble. The truth is, it opens a door in the old keep itself.\"\n\nMirna's gaze grows distant, as if peering back through generations of sorrow. \"I did not speak of it before, because I feared what you might find inside. But with the curse weakened and the village owing you much, hiding the key any longer would be cowardice.\"\n\nShe slides the key across the counter toward you, her hand lingering a moment atop it. \"If you are set on venturing into that place, take it. But promise me, Norn: If you learn what truly happened to the Greymonts... and to those we've lost, you will return and tell me. Some wounds need truth before they can heal.\"\n\nAs Mirna releases the key, you sense the air shift, the weight of tradition and fear yielding to resolve.

She draws in a breath, steadying herself before answering in a low, grave voice.\n\n\"My grandmother was a child when the keep began to change. She remembered laughter and music once--then, whispers in the halls, shadows that moved where none should, and the sudden, dreadful silence when the Greymonts vanished. Some say it was madness, others--curses. But the old tales agree: something unnatural awoke there.\"\n\nShe glances about, as if wary the shadows in her own store might overhear. \"Folk who entered afterward spoke of cold mists, voices calling them by name, and doors locking with no hand upon them. Some never returned. Those who did... well, their minds wandered. My grandmother begged me to keep the key hidden, fearing it might draw the keep's hunger here.\"\n\nMirna fixes you with a steady, haunted look. \"Whatever caused the darkness, Norn, it is not only old grief or broken hearts. It is something that lingers, waiting to be named and challenged. I pray you are strong enough, and that the blessings of the forest and the old wards hold true.\"\n\nThe solemnity of her words hangs in the quiet air--a warning, and perhaps a plea. You sense you have all the information Mirna dares to share, but her faith in you is clear. The fate of Harrow's Hollow, and perhaps more, is now entwined with yours."

The keep may be more than stone and memory--there may be hunger, thirst, and wounds that neither sword nor shield can mend. Take what supplies you need: rations, a lantern, perhaps a sturdy pouch to keep the key safe.\"\n\nShe gestures to the shelves. \"I can offer you most goods at a fair price, and for you, a discount. But more than supplies, remember this: the keep has a will of its own. If you hear voices, do not always trust what they say. If you feel cold wind or see lanterns flicker--that is when the old wards may be weakest. And if you find anything tied to the Greymonts, even the smallest relic or letter, bring it home. We must lay their story to rest if we wish for peace.\"\n\nA moment's silence passes before Mirna adds, softer, \"And Norn... if you need aid or comfort before you go, the people here remember what you've done. You need only ask.\"\n\nThe general store is yours to peruse: lanterns, rations, maps, and a few odd items from distant peddlers line the shelves.

Lanterns of brass and iron glimmer in the morning light, their glass chimneys spotless--a necessity, you know, when darkness must be kept at bay. Nearby, bundles of rations--dried fruit, hard cheese, dense oatcakes--are stacked neatly, promising sustenance even in the heart of ruin. A display of leather pouches draws your attention; one in particular, reinforced at the seams and lined with soft felt, looks well-suited for safeguarding something as precious (and potentially dangerous) as the bronze key.\n\nMirna watches your search quietly, a gentle pride flickering in her expression as you prepare in earnest. \"If you're bound for the keep, Norn,\" she offers from behind the counter, \"I'd suggest the hooded lantern--a bit heavier, but the light can be shuttered if you need to hide. Ten days' rations is more than most need, but it's better to have too much than too little. As for the pouch, take that one with my blessing--no charge. It's sturdy, and the lining should keep that key from jangling or being easily found.\"\n\nShe lifts the pouch from the shelf and sets it on the counter, her gesture quietly supportive.\n\nYou now have a chance to review your choices:\n- Hooded lantern (5 gp)\n- Up to 10 days' rations (5 sp per day)\n- The sturdy, lined leather pouch (gift from Mirna, free of charge)\n\nIs there anything you wish to purchase before you depart for the keep, or would you like to ask Mirna any further questions about supplies, dangers, or the journey itself? Take your time--your careful preparation may make all the difference once you cross into the shadow of the Greymont ruins."

I do have a few bundles of bandages and a pouch of dried feverfew and yarrow--a simple herbal remedy for pain and bleeding. They're no substitute for a healer's touch, but they'll help with scrapes and minor wounds. For anything worse...\" She hesitates, then shakes her head, regretful. \"We don't have true potions or magic salves here--those are rare and costly, even when the roads are safe. Still, take these.\" \n\nShe quickly assembles a modest bundle: several clean bandages, a small tin of herbal salve with a sharp, earthy scent, and a pouch marked with a simple healing rune. \"For you, just 1 gold for the lot. And if you see our village herbalist on your way out--Old Mara, usually near the inn--she might have something stronger.\"\n\nShe rings up your purchases with efficient care, her eyes lingering on you in silent encouragement.\n\nDo you wish to purchase the bandages and salve for 1 gold in addition to your lantern (5 gold) and rations (5 gold)? You may also consider seeking out Mara the herbalist at the Wyrd Lantern Inn for further aid.

If there is more aid to be had, I need to be as ready as possible.\"\n\nWith my purchases in hand, I prepare to make my way to the inn or the next location in Harrow's Hollow, whichever seems most prudent."

Lanterns dangle from exposed beams, their green-tinted glass casting dancing shadows across the bustling taproom. Villagers gather at rough-hewn tables, their voices bright with relief now that the worst of the curse seems broken. \n\nNear the hearth, you spot Mara--the village herbalist--distinguished by the sprigs of dried lavender and yarrow tucked into her thick iron-grey braid. She moves with efficient purpose, a satchel of clinking bottles at her hip as she checks on a limping farmer. When you approach and address her, Mara fixes you with a shrewd, appraising glance through keen brown eyes. \n\n\"So, you're the one who braved the wards and spirits. Hmph. Well, you look sturdy enough, but even the strongest can bleed or break. Sit, then--let's see what I can offer.\"\n\nShe gestures for you to join her at a corner table, glancing around to ensure a measure of privacy. \"I've little in the way of true magic, but I have poultices for wounds and salves for poison, and a tincture that will chase off chills and fever. Not cheap, mind; herbs are hard to come by of late. But for what you've done for the village, I'll offer them at cost--and if you need advice, well, ask your questions plain. The keep is a place that tests more than flesh.\"\n\nMara lays out her wares for your inspection: a bundle of clean poultices (2 gold), a small vial of anti-toxin (5 gold), and a bottle of bitter-smelling tincture (1 gold). She watches you closely as you decide, her worn hands steady but her gaze sharp for any sign of doubt or deeper need.\n\nWhat will you do? Will you purchase any of Mara's remedies, or seek her advice about the threats within the keep? The inn buzzes around you, but here in this quiet corner, the fate of your next steps rests on the knowledge and supplies you choose."

Poison is a danger I cannot afford to underestimate, and wounds will come. The tincture for chills is tempting but I must be prudent with my coin.\"\n\nThen, leaning in slightly with a serious tone, I ask, \"What else can you tell me about the dangers inside the keep?

Don't trust every shadow, but don't dismiss them, either. Sometimes, it's just the keep remembering its dead.\" Mara's eyes flicker, as if recalling old wounds.\n\n\"As for wards--my grandmother used to say, salt at the threshold and iron at the heart. If you find old nails or iron keys within, keep them close. Some doors in that place are sealed for good reason; others open on places that should never touch daylight. And if you find water running where it ought not--step carefully. That means the keep is weeping, and something is stirring in its depths.\"\n\nShe rests her hand briefly over yours, callused fingers surprisingly warm. \"If you hear a child laughing or singing, leave that spot. Those are not voices you want to answer. And never, ever break a circle of salt or candled wax--those are the only things that keep the worst of the old magic penned in.\"\n\nWith a final squeeze, Mara releases your hand. \"Come back, if you can. The village has lost enough to that place.\"\n\nYou now have a bundle of poultices and a vial of anti-toxin. The cost is 7 gold pieces.

Some say he tried to bargain with powers best left unspoken. None from the family were seen after the mists came, only eerie lights and strange laments drifting from the old halls.\" \n\nShe hesitates, then adds, \"There was a daughter, Elenora. They say her spirit lingers, searching for redemption, or perhaps for someone brave enough to set her free. If you find old tokens--a locket, a ribbon--treat them with kindness. The keep clings to memories as tightly as it does to curses.\"\n\nWith your supplies stowed and Mara's warnings echoing in your mind, you rise, feeling the weight of your task settle on your shoulders.

If the road to the keep is barred, perhaps there is more to finish here, or another sign yet to come. Don't mistake patience for idleness--sometimes what we need is revealed after a pause. If there's anything you require before the next step, or anyone in town you wish to speak with, you have but to ask.\"\n\nShe gestures to the shop's wares and the village beyond. \"All of Harrow's Hollow stands ready to lend you what aid it can. Even the bravest need allies and wisdom on the road ahead.\"\n\nHow would you like to spend your time while awaiting the path to the keep? Would you like to stock up on supplies, speak to Mirna or another villager, or simply take a moment to rest and reflect? The village is yours to explore, and your actions now may shape what lies ahead."

Their insights could provide clues or warnings I have yet to hear.\"\n\nI add, with my characteristic honesty, \"And if there is anyone who might need protection or aid while I wait, I want to offer what help I can. I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves, after all.\"\n\nThen, I ask, \"Could you kindly direct me to someone who might have such knowledge, or point me toward those in need?\""

Some say it resists those who are not ready, or perhaps the path itself shifts when old wounds have yet to mend. There are still folk in the village who might offer aid, or mysteries left unsolved. If the way to the keep remains barred, perhaps Harrow's Hollow has more to reveal to you first.\"\n\nShe gestures toward the bustling town square, the wary watch of the militia barracks, the inn with its welcoming lantern, and the quiet path to the east gate. \"Sometimes, Norn, the answers we seek are closer than we think.

Yet, if you wish for my counsel, I will give it plain: The keep feeds on fear and regret. Remember the kindness and courage you carry with you--those are your strongest armor against the darkness inside.\"\n\nShe leans forward, lowering her voice and glancing around. \"The spirits in that place are bound by old wounds. If you find tokens of the Greymont family--letters, crests, or keepsakes--treat them with respect. Sometimes, honoring the past can calm the restless dead more surely than a drawn blade.\"\n\nMirna gently places her weathered hand on yours. \"And Norn--if at any point your heart grows heavy, return here. There is no shame in seeking rest or counsel. The people of this village are behind you. May the light guide your steps, and may the keep itself recognize your purpose.\"\n\nShe gives you a final, reassuring squeeze, then steps back behind the counter.

He's seen lights near the keep and claims to hear voices on the wind. Some call him superstitious, but the keep's not a place for pride.\"\n\nShe glances toward the square through the wide front window. \"Cira, the innkeeper, might know more as well. Elen, the scout you brought home, sometimes talked with her about patrol routes and odd happenings. If you're hoping to help folks, check the notice board--it's got more than its share of pleas for missing livestock and other worries.\"\n\nMirna leans closer, lowering her voice. \"And, Norn, if you're truly looking to protect those in need, don't overlook the outlying farms. Some families are still frightened, and a calm word or a ready arm goes a long way.\"\n\nShe stands back, smoothing her apron. \"You'll find Tommen in the square, Cira at the Wyrd Lantern, and plenty of folk who'd benefit from a hero's presence.

Above it, hammered discreetly into the frame, is a small iron nail stained with age; its head is marked with a faded spiral, a symbol you recall from Mara's tales of warding against restless spirits.\n\nYou find no runes glowing or etched into the stone, but you do notice the stonework itself is unusually tight, as if the wall had once been reinforced against intrusion--mundane or otherwise. The salt line, though worn, was clearly meant to guard the entrance; the iron nail, a silent sentinel against unnatural forces.\n\nThese are not the grand magical wards of legend, but simple folk protections--enough, perhaps, to keep the worst at bay or to buy time should something try to cross.\n\nWith this knowledge, you sense the reverence with which the villagers prepared their homes. You're reminded to proceed with caution and respect, both for the living and the lingering spirits whose peace you seek to restore.\n\nA distant bell chimes in the town square, calling your attention to the life of the village outside.

She offers a small, knowing smile. \"Looking for something, Norn? Many fear what's hidden, but sometimes it's what stands in plain sight that matters most. If you've questions about this place or what lies beyond, you need only ask--I've lived here long enough to remember most things worth remembering.\"\n\nYou feel the gentle encouragement in her words, and the subtle reminder: sometimes the wisdom of those who dwell in a place is as valuable as any hidden clue. The square outside is alive with the day's beginnings--Old Tommen sits near the notice board, and villagers bustle between the inn and the barracks. The fate of Harrow's Hollow and the next step in your quest may well lie in the stories and needs of its people."
