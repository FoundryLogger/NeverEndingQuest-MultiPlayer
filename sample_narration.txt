As the spring snows recede from the highlands, a bitter wind carries with it stories that do not belong to this age. Fishermen on the western cliffs whisper of lights under the sea and voices echoing through their hulls. In the stone-shattered town of Vaelyn’s Wake, a half-drowned monk clawed her way ashore with her tongue severed and strange glyphs etched into her skin — glowing with tidesilver, an element long thought lost to time. She died raving of "The Choir Below" and a bell that tolls in the dark.

Now, the ships anchored in the bay rot from the inside. Children in the harbor speak perfect Draconic in their sleep. And those who sail west… do not return.

Your names have been spoken by an envoy from the Order of the Still Water, who begs for aid and offers passage. Something ancient has awakened far beneath the Tempest Shelf — not merely a threat to Vaelyn’s Wake, but to the tides, to time, and to memory itself. The sea remembers everything. And it is remembering *you*.
