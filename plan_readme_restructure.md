# README Restructuring Plan

## Goal
Restructure the README to clearly highlight the conversation compression and hub-and-spoke campaign architecture as core mechanics for overcoming AI context limitations.

## Key Changes

### 1. Add New Section Near Top: "How It Solves AI Context Limitations"
- Explain the fundamental problem of AI context windows
- Introduce conversation compression as the solution
- Describe hub-and-spoke architecture
- Emphasize "lived-in contextual understanding"

### 2. Restructure Features Overview
- Move conversation compression to top of features
- Clearly explain the mechanics (12 trigger, 6 compression)
- Highlight how this enables infinite campaigns

### 3. Update "How It Works" Section
- Lead with the context management solution
- Explain how adventures accumulate without hitting limits
- Show how NPCs remember you across thousands of interactions

### 4. Create Visual Example
- Show conversation flow: Raw → Compressed → Chronicle
- Demonstrate module transitions with context preservation
- Illustrate hub-and-spoke connections

### 5. Update Architecture Section
- Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for deep dive
- Brief explanation of compression pipeline
- How modules maintain isolation while sharing context

## Benefits to Emphasize
- Infinite adventure length without token limits
- Full contextual memory across modules
- NPCs remember entire relationship history
- Past decisions affect future adventures
- No "amnesia" between sessions
