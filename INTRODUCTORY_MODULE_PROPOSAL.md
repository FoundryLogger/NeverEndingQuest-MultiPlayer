# Introductory Module Proposal: "The Hollow's Edge"

## Module Overview

**Module Name**: The_Hollows_Edge
**Adventure Type**: Mixed (Urban investigation + Wilderness exploration)
**Level Range**: 1-2
**Estimated Length**: 2-3 sessions (8-12 hours)

## Concept Summary

"The Hollow's Edge" serves as a prequel to the Keep of Doom, introducing players to Harrow's Hollow and establishing Elen as a trusted ally. The adventure centers on investigating strange occurrences at the edge of town - livestock disappearing, eerie lights in the old mill, and whispers of something stirring in the abandoned mines. Through this smaller-scale mystery, players will:

1. Meet and work alongside Scout Elen
2. Establish themselves as capable problem-solvers in Harrow's Hollow
3. Uncover hints of the greater darkness to come
4. Build relationships with key NPCs like Elder Mirna

2. **Elen's Concerns**: She mentions investigating "strange happenings near the old keep"

### Character Building:
- Elen trusts the party with personal concerns

- Elder Mirna takes notice of their deeds

## Module Themes

### Primary Theme: Encroaching Darkness
- Darkness literally seeping from below
- Metaphorical darkness as peace is disturbed
- Small problems hiding larger threats

### Secondary Theme: Trust and Community
- Outsiders earning their place
- Elen as bridge between party and town
- Strength through alliance (potential goblin cooperation)

## Design Notes for Module Creation

### Tone:
- Less epic than Keep of Doom, more personal
- Focus on building relationships
- Mix investigation with action
- Create attachment to Elen and the Hollow

### Difficulty:
- Balanced for new characters
- Teaching opportunities (tracking, investigation, negotiation)
- Survivable but challenging
- Clear retreat options if overwhelmed

### Pacing:
- Faster than Keep of Doom
- Each act should be completable in one session
- Clear transitions between acts
- Builds to urgent finale with Elen's disappearance

## Final Scene Script

*As the party celebrates in the Wyrd Lantern Inn, a young guard bursts through the door, rain-soaked and breathless.*

**Guard**: "Is... is the ranger Elen's friends here? The ones who cleared the mines?"

*He produces a sealed letter with Elen's mark - the wooden raven token matches.*

**Letter**: "If you're reading this, then my worst fears have come true. I've gone to investigate the old keep on the marsh road - the Shadowfall. The darkness we found in the mines... I believe it's connected. If I don't return by dawn, please... the Hollow needs heroes. Elder Mirna will have more information. Trust her. And thank you for showing me I could trust outsiders. May the wind be at your back. - Elen"

*Elder Mirna enters, her face grave.*

**Elder Mirna**: "So she went despite my warnings. That stubborn girl... Please, you're the only ones she trusted. Will you find her?"
